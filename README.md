# Sanderson-Diary

This is a record of the diary of Verner Stuart Leslie Sanderson, describing his experiences in the first World War from the period July 17th 1915 to August 3rd 1917.

He was in signals and was responsible for maintaining communications, whatever that night have entailed. We can only imagine what that might have been, but can get some idea from the diary.

Not only is the hand-written diary transcribed, but it's extended with batallion daily extracts, maps, images, videos and links to more information. You can spend much time exploring this diary and hopefully understand what it was like from the words of somebody who was there at the time.

It's a small blue booklet that the author must have carried with him in his pocket in the trenches. He must have added to it day by day with the thought that one day somebody would read it. Now we all can.
