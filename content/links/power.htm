          <p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">Probably the most striking success of all the
          alternative methods of communication in 1917 fell to the previously despised power buzzer
          and amplifier. Signals were transmitted through the earth by means of buzzers and were
          picked up on an ordinary telephone receiver connected to widely seperated earths. With the
          early buzzers, the overhearing problem was so acute at the time that all means of
          signalling which frankly depended upon overhearing for their success could not be expected
          to find favour. It was , perhaps,&nbsp; natural that the french should take a prominent
          part in the development of this type of signalling. Their engineers were the inventors of
          the original valve listening set. Their idea of forward signals differed considerably from
          the British, their system being directed much more toward getting back information from
          the front line, and less toward the conveyance forward of orders and instructions. One-way
          working from front to rear, therefore, presented many more attractions to the french
          Signal Service than to the British.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">It was from the French, also, that the next step in
          the development of earth induction telegraphy came. This was the introduction to the
          British Army of the French "Parleur," which was the earlier equivalent of the
          British power buzzer. The possibilities of this large buzzer, worked by accumulators and
          with short earth leads, 100 to 150 yards in length, was at once seen and in 1916 it was
          generally adopted throughout our own Army. A proportion of the available listening sets
          were set aside to receive the messages sent by this means from selected forward spots and
          in the battles on the Somme and the Ancre these instruments gave valuable service.They
          were on the whole unfavourably reported upon, however, for deveral reasons. The buzzers
          themselves were fairly robust instruments, but the accumulators needed a certain amount of
          care and had to be carried in an upright position. The signaller stumbling along in the
          dusk across shell-pitted, wire-infested country, frequently arrived at his destination
          with his power buzzer in order, but with accumulators quite dry, having distributed the
          acid between his clothes, his other equipment, and the ground over which he had passed.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><img src="power_files/powerbuzzerSide.jpg" alt="PowerBuzzerSide.jpg (24006 bytes)" height="270" width="360"></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">The difficulty of one-way working was overcome to
          some extent by the invention of special amplifier sets and their provision in large
          quantities. The opening&nbsp; of the 1917 campaigns thus found the earth induction set in
          a much stronger position than it had held the previous year. This was soon reflected in
          the reports of signal officers and of regimental officers, too. Again and again, it was
          recorded that when all other communication had gone, poere buzzer and amplifier sets had
          bridged the gap until better conditions returned. Most of the occasions were for a few
          hours only and the number of messages handled was of course relatively small. At
          Bullercourt, however, in May 1917, during the attacks on the Hindenberg line, the
          classical instance occurred which illustrated at its best the value of this means of
          signalling under favourable circumstances. For several days, the shelling had been so
          intense that no groung or air communication was possible between the Australians in the
          Hidenberg line east of Bullercourt and their supports. Wireless aerials would not stand
          up; lines were blasted off the face of the earth, runners left the trenches only to be
          blown to pieces, the supply of pigeons could not be maintained. Deep down in the tunnels
          and caverns beneath the line, however, were installed two power buzzers and amplifiers.
          With their bases securely hidden in the tunnels and with the sets themselves under many
          feet of headcover, they remained inviolate. For several days after the line was occupied
          these sets kept up constant communication with other sets further to the rear, and gave
          warning of several counter-attacks which were successfully repulsed.</font></p>
          <p align="left"><font color="#ffffff">After this and other less dramatic but useful
          successes, the power buzzer achieved some degree of popularity and was used to a great
          extent as part of the normal intercommunication system in position warfare. In 1918 it was
          further improved by the issue of a combined set which made the two-way station more
          compact and portable.</font></p>
