    Captain S. J. Worsley, D.S.O., M.C.</i></font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Delville Wood is a name, 
    even now, full of sadness and the suppressed agony of thousands who had to 
    make its acquaintance.&nbsp; Probably nearly as many men remained in it as 
    came out of it whole, and no one fortunate to escape from this hell can 
    think of it without recalling hours of suffering and the names of many good 
    comrades now no more.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Towards the end of September 1916 there seemed to be a lull in the Battle of 
    the Somme.&nbsp; The glory of the first great achievements had somewhat 
    faded with the realization of their cost and the doubtful value of their 
    gains.&nbsp; One supposed that the High Command knew what they were doing, 
    though even that is doubtful now.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most of us hoped that the lull meant a discontinuance of the battle, which 
    seemed a hopeless hammering at a resourceful enemy in one of his strongest 
    sectors.&nbsp; It was, however, not for us to argue why the strong rather 
    than the weak positions were always to be attacked.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyhow our battalion, which 
    had previously been in the line in front of Guillemont, moved into Delville 
    Wood to take over the line on the eastern edge of the wood.&nbsp; The 
    journey, as usual, began soon enough to bring us into the danger zone about 
    dusk and was a nightmare.&nbsp; We were led by guides who had hardly been 
    able to leave the front line and were hopeless, while landmarks had long ago 
    been blown out of existence.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Every semblance of a trench 
    seemed full of dead-sodden, squelchy, swollen bodies.&nbsp; Fortunately the 
    blackening faces were invisible except when Verey lights lit up the 
    indescribable scene.&nbsp; Not a tree stood whole in that wood.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The weary tramp in single file went on for about three hours.&nbsp; Men 
    carried heavy loads of equipment, bombs, rifle ammunition, Lewis guns, 
    petrol tins of water, gas helmets, and so on.&nbsp; How they cursed as they 
    one after the other collided with some obstacle or fell flat on a dead body.&nbsp; 
    "Pass it along when you're all up," "Mind the wire," "Mind the hole on the 
    left" - interspersed with humorous though trite remarks as to the first five 
    years being the worst.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, after much searching, but without serious mishap, we found our 
    sector: Two companies of the battalion were in front and two in support some 
    distance back.&nbsp; Battalion Headquarters lay behind the wood.&nbsp; "C" 
    Company, in which I had charge of a platoon, was on the right flank in a 
    shallow, incomplete depression shown on the map as Edge Trench, its name 
    indicating its position skirting the wood.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By this time it was just after midnight and all was fairly quiet.&nbsp; As 
    far as we knew there was no particular cause for alarm.&nbsp; The officers 
    and senior N.C.O.'s had got the hang of things and knew roughly the position 
    of the other troops in the neighbourhood and of the enemy, who seemed quite 
    a good distance away immediately in front, though away to the right he was 
    considerably closer to the line.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was at the time twenty-one years of age, my company commander twenty-two, 
    but we had both had a good deal of experience - sufficient to realize that 
    in case of anything like a bombardment a position on the edge of a very well 
    known wood would be no fun.&nbsp; Hence we decided to push forward.&nbsp; 
    Each platoon would send a strong section some fifty to one hundred yards 
    ahead to dig itself in.&nbsp; If we were left in peace a night or two, our 
    men, nearly all miners, would join up the posts and make a continuous and 
    less clearly defined front line.&nbsp; So the detached posts went out.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
    <img src="delvillewood_files/britishguncrew.jpg" alt="British 15-inch gun crew" align="right" border="0" height="266" width="182">The wished-for peace was not for us, unfortunately.&nbsp; At 2 a.m. the 
    officers met the company commander in the one and only dug-out to discuss 
    "work done and work proposed" for the daily return, and to look at some 
    preliminary orders for a rather big advance three days ahead. </font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After 
    that I was temporarily off duty, but I had no sooner settled myself in the 
    dug-out for what I considered a well-earned "shut-eye" till stand-to before 
    dawn, when pandemonium broke out.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was soon apparent that something very unpleasant was about to happen, so 
    we stood to arms, groused a good deal, and waited.&nbsp; The waiting was 
    always the hardest part of it all.&nbsp; The hours till 6 a.m. seemed 
    terribly long, but our casualties had not been more than fifteen all told.&nbsp; 
    The worst of it was that the wounded and even the runners, stout fellows 
    though they were, could not get away or reach Headquarters with our tale of 
    woe.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just about six o'clock the Germans came on.&nbsp; They never approached 
    closer than 150 yards from our trench and they made an excellent target for 
    Lewis guns and lost heavily.&nbsp; By 8.30 I heard that the company 
    commander was out of action, though not seriously wounded.&nbsp; Then came 
    the even more serious news that my fellow subaltern had been killed on the 
    right, where the enemy had forced an entrance.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The battalion on the right had also been forced to abandon their line.&nbsp; 
    This left me very much alone, with between but fifty and sixty men who could 
    use a rifle.&nbsp; Some of these were wounded, but any escape from the 
    trench was out of the question.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By 9 a.m. there was comparative peace, except in our minds when we grasped 
    the seriousness of the situation.&nbsp; It seemed that the left had also 
    broken and that our two depleted companies were in the blue.&nbsp; The left 
    company had fared better than we.&nbsp; On our right the Germans and we 
    shared a trench - only a narrow barrier separating us from them.&nbsp; 
    Moreover, this barrier was on the wrong side of Company Headquarters, which, 
    with our greatcoats, food, and orders, was lost to us.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The only thing to do was to strengthen the barrier as best we could and lie 
    low.&nbsp; There would probably be dirty work at that barrier later on.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Conditions in the wood were now worse than ever.&nbsp; Most of us felt sick 
    and ill even when unwounded.&nbsp; Food and water were very short and we had 
    not the faintest idea when any more would be obtainable.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By the end of the next day several, including myself, had dysentery, and 
    that in a ghastly battered trench with no prospect of medical attention.&nbsp; 
    After all, we stood and lay on putrefying bodies and the wonder was that the 
    disease did not finish off what the shells of the enemy had started.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The day was, in fact, uneventful; but as evening drew on we again prepared 
    for the fray.&nbsp; It was not to be supposed that the success of the enemy 
    would not be pushed home, and, as far as we could tell, only two weak 
    companies stood between them and the possession of Delville Wood.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
    <img src="delvillewood_files/reimscathedral.jpg" alt="First artillery hit on Rheims cathedral" align="left" border="0" height="197" width="187">Sure enough, the attack 
    began at dusk and again it lasted for three hours.&nbsp; This time it was no 
    frontal attack across the open but a determined push down the shared trench 
    and behind in the shelter of the stumps of trees.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is difficult, and 
    even a week later it was difficult, to recall those three hours.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is only on Armistice Day that I can live them again; but I don't want 
    tell anyone about it.&nbsp; There was hand-to-hand fighting with knives, 
    bombs, and bayonets; cursing and brutality on both sides such as men can be 
    responsible for when it is a question of "your life or mine"; mud and filthy 
    stench; dysentery and unattended wounds; shortage of food and water and 
    ammunition.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fighting ceased and a curiously fitful peace settled over the scene.&nbsp; 
    In some ways fighting was preferable - one's mind was distracted.&nbsp; 
    Inactivity in such surroundings was harder than risking one's life.&nbsp; 
    For an hour or two that night I lay on a board in a bay of the trench and 
    slept.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But an hour before dawn we were at it again, getting ready for the expected 
    onslaught at daybreak.&nbsp; Why this did not come I have never been able to 
    make out.&nbsp; There was no reason at all why the wood should not have been 
    recaptured completely, especially as, on looking through our supplies, we 
    could not muster more than 500 rounds of rifle ammunition and thirty bombs.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By this time I was getting beyond effective command, but my senior sergeant 
    was still very much alive and as aggressive as ever.&nbsp; His suggestion 
    was that we should take a big risk as no attack appeared to be developing 
    and have a shot at regaining Company Headquarters.&nbsp; I am afraid that 
    the object of the projected operation was food rather than secret orders.&nbsp; 
    Four others volunteered to see what could be done, and before dawn was far 
    advanced we peeped carefully over the barrier half-expecting something 
    unpleasant.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One German was asleep on a 
    fire-step five or six yards from us, and there was not a sign of activity.&nbsp; 
    In these circumstances we agreed to risk it. I, being armed with a revolver, 
    was to act as a sort of advanced guard while the others were to trail behind 
    with bombs and bayonets to deal with any opposition.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The essential factor for success was quietness - no bomb throwing or 
    shooting except as a last resource.&nbsp; Nothing but a bayonet was in fact 
    necessary, much to our amazement.&nbsp; Some half-dozen weary and comatose 
    Germans were quietly and expeditiously removed from the active list, and 
    Company Headquarters was gained in safety.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet there were no reprisals.&nbsp; Apparently no German officer or N.C.O. 
    came round, and to our joy we were able unmolested to move the best part of 
    our barrier to a point 50 yards beyond the Headquarters dug-out.&nbsp; We 
    found all the officers' kit, food, and orders intact, but neatly packed up 
    as though for removal.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
    <img src="delvillewood_files/stmihiel.jpg" alt="The Fort du Camp des Romains, St. Mihiel" align="right" border="0" height="121" width="217">The mystery of this non-interference is unexplained and I can only surmise 
    that a few tired troops had got left behind, although the main forces of the 
    enemy had for some reason or other been withdrawn.&nbsp; All that day not a 
    shot was fired, though our nerves had gone almost to pieces and we were sure 
    we should be amply repaid for our early morning escapade.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But no word came from the outside world, which seemed very remote, until 
    about four o'clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; At that hour a British aeroplane 
    appeared flying low and calling for signals.&nbsp; With great joy we sent up 
    our flares to indicate our position.&nbsp; I have always wanted to thank 
    that airman.&nbsp; He must have taped us out with great accuracy, because 
    when an hour later our own guns opened fire and put a box barrage round us, 
    not a single shell fell in our lines.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This bombardment meant that an attack was being launched in order to get us 
    out and at dusk the attack came.&nbsp; A whole brigade of infantry, well 
    supported by artillery, had been put in to restore the line, and they did it 
    splendidly despite the heavy shelling of the enemy, especially on the thick 
    areas through which they had advanced.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gradually we were able to 
    slip away.&nbsp; I had now pronounced dysentery and was helped by two men.&nbsp; 
    We were all so far gone and so tired that we never hesitated to rest when 
    and where we felt inclined, shelling or no shelling.&nbsp; I called at 
    Battalion Headquarters and reported as best I could what had happened.&nbsp; 
    The "powers-that-be" were most complimentary on the work of the company and 
    the adjutant's "Well done, 'C' Company!" made up for a good deal.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a wretched night in a dug-out in Montauban I went down sick, glad to 
    be out of things for a bit, but rather conscience-stricken at such an 
    inglorious departure; a wound would have been much more satisfying.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some weeks later I received a chatty letter from the adjutant, who told me a 
    touching story.&nbsp; He asked if I remembered the posts we had sent out in 
    front the night we occupied Edge Trench.&nbsp; It came as rather a shock to 
    find that I had, indeed, in all that confusion and scrapping forgotten them.&nbsp; 
    He went on to say that two days after we had been relieved the new people 
    had discovered a section of my platoon still doing the job they had been 
    sent out to do.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
    <img src="delvillewood_files/frenchoutpost.jpg" alt="French outpost on the Franco-Belgian frontier" align="left" border="0" height="259" width="217">The Corporal and his men had been out there for four days with no food other 
    than emergency rations, but they had remained interested spectators of a 
    good deal of the fighting, though in their exposed position they dared not 
    move much.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The relieving company 
    commander told them about the relief, and said they had better clear out.</font></font></p>
<font face="Verdana">    </font><p align="justify"><font face="Verdana"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To this the corporal 
    replied that he had no intention of moving without a personal or written 
    order from one of his own officers.&nbsp; This order the adjutant had 
    supplied.</font></font></p>
