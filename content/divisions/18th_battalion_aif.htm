        A.I.F. A short history.</font></b></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2"><br>
        The four companies of the 18th Battalion sailed aboard the converted
        liner 'Ceramic' on 25 June 1915 bound for Egypt via the Suez Canal.
        The 1st and 2nd Reinforcements had already sailed via separate vessels.
        However, the real story of the 18th Battalion begins about eight months
        earlier. In 1914 the actions of a single man twelve thousand miles away
        had a significant impact on the lives of all Australians for years to
        come. As a result of Gavrilo Princip’s assassination of the Archduke
        Ferdinand of Austria the major powers of Europe went to war. Australia’s
        still close relationship with the mother country resulted in Andrew
        Fisher's commitment to raising a force of twenty thousand men. This
        force sailed out from Sydney aboard the transport vessel 'Berrima'
        on 18 August 1914 bound for New Guinea. Aboard were several men of the
        soon to be formed 18th Battalion: men such as Captain Cyril Herbert
        Dodson Lane, adjutant to Colonel William Holmes.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2"> Captain Sydney Percival
        Goodsell was the quartermaster and Lieutenant Rupert Markham Sadler took
        charge of the signalling section. It was late September when the 1st
        Battalion AN&amp;MEF arrived in New Guinea and started the task of
        removing the German presence. Other members of the 18th who took part
        were Allan Forbes Anderson, Roy Arnold, Basil Blackett, Errol Cappie
        Nepean Devlin, William Johnston Graham, Nicholas Hamlyn Hobbs, John
        Bayley Lane, Frederick McGlashan, Bruce McLachlan, Charles George
        Walklate, Basil Bruce Williamson and Herbert Wiseman. The AN&amp;MEF’s
        assignment was successful with limited casualties but resulted in those
        enlisting in the early days did not become members of the AIF until
        after the Gallipoli landings.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">The voyage from Sydney to Egypt was
        uneventful until they entered the Suez Canal and first sighted land. The
        'Ceramic' held up at Aden with word that the troops would be used in
        garrison duties to quell a native uprising. This did not take place and
        the rest of the trip was quiet. After four weeks in Egypt orders were
        issued to Lieutenant Colonel Alfred Chapman to prepare for embarkation
        to Gallipoli to reinforce the men already there. The early August
        assaults on Lone Pine and The Nek had taken their toll and the powers
        that be still believed a break through was possible.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">The 18th Battalion arrived on
        Gallipoli as fresh-faced troops eager for battle. Two days later this
        was completely shattered and the romantic myth of war was lost forever.
        Orders were issued almost immediately for the battalion to move up to
        the front line. Many of the men were not aware that they were to assault
        Hill 60 until just before 5.00am on the morning of 22 August 1915. Hill
        60 was considered of strategic importance for two reasons. First of all
        it overlooked the much of the Anzac positions and second of all who ever
        controlled it also controlled two wells that supplied water.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">Syd Goodsell (now a major) led his
        company into murderous machine gun and rifle fire and several men were
        killed. He managed to get his a considerable number of his men into the
        first line of Turkish trenches before halting. Chapman could see that
        more men were needed so he ordered the next two companies into the
        firing line. Captain Alexander McKean (a school teacher from Penrith),
        part of the second wave, was struck in the shoulder and took no more
        active part in the war. Cyril Lane (also a major and company commander
        of 'B' Company) lost most of his men before reaching Goodsell
        attempting to consolidate.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">One young man, Private Joseph Maxwell,
        was appointed stretcher-bearer of 'B' Company and believed he would
        not get much opportunity to participate; he was wrong. After failing to
        make further headway through the day someone gave the order to withdraw
        although no one knew issued it. Those that managed to survive were
        shattered with the loss of so many friends and (in some cases)
        brothers.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">If those still fit thought that was
        their first and last experience of total carnage they were wrong. Just
        five days later the Battalion was ordered back into the line for a
        second attempt to remove the Turks from Hill 60. Chapman called for
        volunteers this time and every fit and able man stepped forward. This
        time they were successful in securing a foothold on the hill but many
        more men were killed, including the heroic Lane, struck once in the
        heart by a bullet during a bomb fight with the enemy.<br>
        The 18th Battalion remained on Gallipoli until the end in December 1915
        before evacuating without casualties. Major George Murphy (later
        battalion commander) transferred from the 20th to the 18th Battalion
        just after the August debacle.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">Lieutenant-Colonel Alfred Chapman was
        relieved and returned to Australia. Evan Wisdom took over as battalion
        commander but was destined for higher honours. Three months after their
        return to Egypt they were setting sail yet again this time for the
        Western Front. They arrived in France on 25 March 1916 almost to full
        strength and moved into the front line, for the first time in April
        1916. The word was that the AIF would only be used for patrolling and
        garrison duties but during the night of 25/26 June 1916 the 5th Brigade
        (with members of the 18th Battalion) they made their first trench raid.
        Captain John Bayley Lane (of the AN&amp;MEF) was the senior officer of
        the battalion. The following night they did it again. Both raids were
        successful although one man was taken prisoner, Walter Frick (although
        not mentioned by name Bean makes reference to his capture).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2"><br>
        The 18th Battalion (as part of the 2nd Division replaced the weary
        members of the 1st Division in late July 1916 at Pozieres and suffered
        just as severely until withdrawn at the end of the first week in August.
        The acting battalion commander George Murphy was severely wounded during
        the campaign and did not return until late October 1916. Syd Goodsell
        fell ill in August 1916 and was evacuated and did not return. It was
        about this time that the AIF recognised the leadership qualities many of
        the 'other ranks' and started promoting these men to officers.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2"><br>
        The next major battle the 18th Battalion took place in was Malt Trench
        in February 1917 after the men went through the worst winter in France
        for forty years. It was at this time that the first recommendations for
        Victoria Crosses were made for members of the battalion. Edwin Nipperess
        and Eric Allsop were awarded Military Medals for exceptional courage in
        two separate incidents. Five men lay out in the open and Nipperess
        crawled out, under fifteen feet of wire entanglements and heavy fire,
        and rescued the three wounded men. They were lying on the enemy parapet
        and were being systematically fired upon although they were not offering
        any sort of resistance.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">He dragged them, one by one, from the
        parapet into shell holes in the open. He then carried each man across
        the Bapaume Road, under machine gun fire, back to the safety. He then
        returned and also dragged the corpses of the other two back to ensure
        the Germans were not able to identify the battalion that was opposing
        them. (Nipperess and Allsop were both killed before the year ended.)</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">
        Before the year ended the Battalion had fought at Bullecourt, Ypres and Passchendaele.
        1918 saw an end to stagnate trench warfare as the Battalion started
        actively patrolling. Joseph Maxwell (awarded a DCM in Ypres as a CSM)
        was now a 2nd Lieutenant and led many of these patrols. He was awarded
        the Military Cross in March 1918 whilst on patrol.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">He was collecting intelligence with a
        patrol of thirty men when he was about to return. As he was covering his
        party he observed sixty or so Germans entering a trench system nearby.
        He recalled his men and they attacked the unsuspecting Huns. A brief
        struggle ensued before the enemy withdrew.</font></p>

        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">
        The battalion's only failure (if it could be called that) during their
        three years on the Western Front took place at Hangard Wood in April
        1918. The 5th Brigade where to attack the wood whilst their French
        allies were to take the Cemetery nearby. The attack started out
        according to plan but during the following morning it became imperative
        that the French had to take the cemetery to succeed. This did not happen
        and the order to withdraw was given.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">Ironically enough a short while later
        the French took, and held, their objective. Of the five officers and one
        hundred and seventy five men who took part, four officers and about
        eighty men had been hit during the attack.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">
        In May 1918 the battalion was at Morlancourt were one of the most
        remarkable events took place. On the 17th Lieutenant Alex Irvine was at
        the front line when he realised most of the men were dozing or asleep.
        Boyce replied, "The Hun will be asleep, too." This gave Irvine
        an idea and the following morning he took eighteen men quietly over the
        parapet and across 'No Man’s Land' They entered the enemy trenches
        without a shot being fired and just ten minutes later were returning
        with prisoners and intelligence. (John Laffin in the Australians At War
        series wrongly attributed Irvine as belonging to the 17th Battalion).</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">
        It was becoming quite obvious at this time that the Germans were going
        to lose the war and launched they final offensive in August 1918. The
        18th Battalion was heavily involved in this fighting on 8 and 9 August
        1918 with many heroic deeds being performed. The battalion was required
        to make its way to the jumping off point through thick fog and many men
        from all battalions lost their way. CSM Albert Dickinson took it upon
        himself to ensure men of the 18th reached the required destination.
        Captain John Bayley Lane was recommended for a Victoria Cross for his
        actions on this day as he displayed outstanding leadership qualities.
        Yet again the battalion did not receive the highest honour as Lane
        received a DSO instead. Bill Graham (Boer War, New Guinea and Gallipoli
        veteran) continued to brilliantly lead his men and continued through
        these two days before succumbed to wounds (struck in the shoulder and
        then in the buttocks).&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">Through the month of August 1918 the
        battalion fought frantically with the enemy trying to regain the upper
        hand before given the opportunity for a rest.</font></p>
        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">The 18th Battalion took part in their
        last battle of the war on 3 October 1918 when they were required to take
        and hold a stretch of the Beaurevior Line near St Quentin. Joseph
        Maxwell was awarded the military's highest honour on this day by his
        excellent example he displayed. Early on in the fighting he assumed
        command of his company after the commander was severely wounded. He came
        across wire six belts thick so he worked his way, alone, through it and
        killed the destroyed the enemy machine gun post before returning and
        leading his men through it. The fighting was heavy but finally their
        position was consolidated and prisoners were being brought in. One
        suggested to Joe Maxwell that there were others who wanted to surrender
        so he took two men to locate them. They walked into a trap and it was
        only through a barrage which started was Maxwell able to regain the
        upper hand and escape.</font></p>

        the final time as the Great War ended just over four weeks later.<br>

        <h2><font color="#0000ff" size="2">18th Battalion</font></h2>

        <p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">The 18th Battalion was raised at
        Liverpool in New South Wales in March 1915 as part of the 5th Brigade.
        It left Australia in early May, trained in Egypt from mid-June until
        mid-August, and on 22 August landed at ANZAC Cove.</font>
        </p><p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">The battalion had not been ashore a
        day when it was committed to the last operation of the August Offensive
        (the attack on Hill 60) which lasted until 29 August and cost it
        50 per cent casualties. For the rest of the campaign the 18th played a
        purely defensive role, being primarily responsible for holding
        Courtney's Post. The last members of the battalion left Gallipoli on
        20 December.</font>
        </p><p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">After further training in Egypt, the
        18th Battalion proceeded to France. Landing there on 25 March 1916, it
        took part in its first major battle at Pozieres between 25 July and 5
        August. The battalion returned to the Pozieres trenches for a second
        time in late August. After a spell in a quieter sector of the front in
        Belgium, the 2nd Division including the 5th Brigade, came south again in
        October. The 18th Battalion was spared from having to mount an attack
        across the quagmire that the Somme battlefield had become, but did have
        to continue manning the front through a very bleak winter.</font>
        </p><p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">In 1917 the 18th was involved in the
        follow up of German forces during their retreat to the Hindenburg Line,
        and was involved in some particularly heavy fighting around Warlencourt
        in late February. The battalion took part in three major battles before
        the year was out: the second Bullecourt (3–4 May) in France; and Menin
        Road (20–22 September) and Poelcappelle (9–10 October) in Belgium.</font>
        </p><p><font color="#0000ff" size="2">After another winter of trench duty,
        the spring of 1918 brought a major German offensive that the 18th
        Battalion helped to repel. With this last desperate offensive turned
        back, the Allied armies turned to the offensive and the 18th
        participated in the battles that pushed the German Army ever closer to
        defeat: Amiens on 8 August, the legendary attack on Mont St Quentin on
        31 August, and the forcing of the Beaurevoir Line around Montbrehain on
        3 October. For his actions at Montbrehain, Lieutenant Joseph Maxwell was
        awarded the Victoria Cross. Montbrehain was the battalion’s last
        battle; it was training out of the line when the armistice was declared
        and was disbanded on 11 April 1919.</font>
