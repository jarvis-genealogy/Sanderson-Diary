        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We detrained at St. Roch station, Amiens, on the evening of the 7<sup>TH</sup>
        October and marched 10 miles to billets in La Chaussee and Tirancourt. We had passed
        through many vicissitudes since we arrived at the same station just six months before.
        Then, with faces set with grim determination we had been hurried out along the road to
        Albert, the last resource of the British Army. Now we returned, tired, war worn, more
        veterans than ever as a victorious army, which had shown the world by its final campaign
        what Australia could do when she was up against it.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At La Chaussee, the battalion could not muster more than one decent
        sized company for parade and when we were again ordered to sink our identity as the 21<sup>st</sup>
        Battalion and join the 24<sup>th</sup> Battalion as &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;
        Companies, we could see the inevitability of the move. Our career as an independent unit
        ended at 10 am on the 13<sup>th</sup> October when the C.O. officially handed us over to
        Major W. H. Ellwood, M.C. of the 24<sup>th</sup> Battalion.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We continued to live together at Tirancourt Chateau, both Companies
        being entirely officered from the 21<sup>st</sup> Battalion. The C.O. 24<sup>th</sup>
        Battalion (Lieut.-Col. W.E. James, D.S.O.) was most considerate to us and we made friends
        with the other companies very quickly. Musketry and football were the chief forms of
        amusement, our &quot;D&quot; Company only being beaten by a strong H.Q. team for a
        football cup. Number 10 Platoon of &quot;C&quot; Company under Lieut. B. Besemeres won in
        succession the Battalion, Brigade and Divisional Championships over a 400-Yard Bullet and
        Bayonet course. The billets were roomy and amid lovely surroundings, also we were issued
        with mattresses for the first time on record. On the whole, it was a great spell and we
        were just thinking of our move back to the line when the news of the Armistice arrived on
        11<sup>th</sup> November. There was no noisy demonstration, such as took place in the
        cities outside the war zone, the fact was too stunning for us to realise, surrounded as we
        were with all the usual routine of war.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the 20<sup>th</sup> November, the 24<sup>th</sup> Battalion with its
        two new companies entrained at Vignacourt for Busigny in the occupied territory, but,
        owing to a delayed mine blowing up the railway, detrained short of its destination. We put
        in the night at a neighbouring camp and on successive days marched to Busigny, St.
        Souplet, and Boulogne-sur-Helpe, when we arrived on the 24<sup>th</sup> November and
        stayed for three weeks. The weather was bad and the billets were crowded but we extracted
        entertainment from football and the stories of the German occupation, which we heard from
        the inhabitants. While here, was formed the &quot;1915 Company&quot; composed of original
        members of the unit who were to be sent home first.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 17<sup>th</sup> December we marched towards our winter quarters in
        Belgium, near Charleroi, staging at Solre-le-Chateau (15 miles), Solre-le-Gerv (10 miles),
        Alcourt (10 miles), to Nalinnes (5 miles) where we arrived with colours flying, giving as
        good an imitation of the conquering hero as we could in the rain. Our billets here were
        roomy and clean. The inhabitants showed us every kindness and we enjoyed the Christmas
        season in spite of the cold weather. Each Company had its own Christmas dinner and all
        were voted successful. Charleroi was 11kilos away by train and leave was plentiful.
        Brussels&#146; leave also became available in January 1919 and a Brigade Club was opened
        in that city with the profits made by the brigade cinema, which proved a popular form of
        diversion in out little community.</p>
        <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The first draft for Australia left on the27th December 1918 and the
        remainder of the original men and nine officers left on 13<sup>th</sup> January 1919.
        These were quickly followed by all those who embarked in 1915 after which the Battalion
        was brigaded under Lieut.-Col. A.R.L. Wiltshire, C.M.G. D.S.O. M.C. 22<sup>nd</sup>
        Battalion, first for Gourdinnes and later Marcinelles.</p>

    <p>At this stage our story must end. We do not claim that it is pretentious literary
    achievement, but have aimed at telling the truth at all times. We trust that this short
    resume will find its way into the hands of every ex-member of the Battalion, and that it
    may bring back happy memories of the good times, even if a bit hard, which we spent
    together while engaged on the great adventure. </font></p>
