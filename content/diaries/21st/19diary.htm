<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 1st 1919.</u></b>
About midnight every boat in Harbour blew it's whistle in honour
of the New Year.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 2nd 1919.</u></b>
11.30 am. Pulled into the Quay and loaded some Light Horse, 250
in all. 2.15 pm. Moved off once more.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 3rd 1919.</u></b>
We are now in the Red Sea.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 4th 1919.</u></b>
Very rough and windy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 5th 1919.</u></b>
Still in the Red Sea with a terrible head wind.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 6th 1919.</u></b>
9 am. Passed Aden. Could see the coast of Arabia all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 7th 1919.</u></b>
My birthday. This is the second spent on the water. <b>( 22 years
old )</b> </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 8th 1919.</u></b>
Passed some islands on the north side today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 9th and
10th 1919.</u></b> Saw some land in the distance today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 11th 1919.</u></b>
My leg has broken out again. So am now a candidate for bandages.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 12th 1919.</u></b>
Getting very hot now.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 13th 1919.</u></b>
9 am. Sighted the coast of Ceylon. 10 am. Pulled into Colombo.
Coaled and took water. It is just scorching.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 14th 1919</u></b>.
Nothing doing. Bar to break ship and go into Colombo. Had a good
time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 15th 1919.</u></b>
5 pm. Pulled out. Much cooler now.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 16th 1919.</u></b>
Very rough and hot today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 17th 1919.</u></b>
Calmer but still hot.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 18th 1919.</u></b>
Very oppressive. During the day we saw many flying fish. Had fish
for breakfast and oh! my??? one could smell it two miles away. So
all the chaps put it in a tub and tied a rope to it. This they
dragged round and round the promenade deck, playing the Dead
March in Saul, and finally came to a halt in front of the saloon
door. One of the chaps read the burial service which ended up
&quot;Ashes to Ashes, Dust to Dust, the troops won't eat you, so
the Sharks Must&quot;. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Officers could do
nothing else but laugh.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 19th 1919.</u></b>
Poor old padre was waiting at the time appointed for Church
Parade but he was like a jilted bride, no one patronised him
because they blew the bugle half an hour too early. All the lads
decided he could go to -------, so we had none. 7 pm. Had a
terrific storm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 20th 1919.</u></b>
Saw a number of whales today. Still very warm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 21st 1919.</u></b>
Much cooler today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 22nd 1919.</u></b>
Real Aussie weather today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 23rd 1919.</u></b>
About 1 am. it came up very rough. The old boat has been tossing
about all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 24th 1919.</u></b>
Very rough. The boat has been dipping from 5 feet well over the
anchors near 38 feet. It is about the roughest we have ever had.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 25th 1919.</u></b>
Much calmer. There was a heavy haze all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 26th 1919.</u></b>
Rained all day. Just as we came up from tea at 5.15 pm. we saw
the first of our dear old homeland Aussie. It is what we have
been looking for for nearly four years, and even now it seems for
all the world a dream. I cannot for the life of me realise it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 27th 1919.</u></b>
7 am. Very near the coast, and can see enormous breakers,
breaking into clouds of spray on the rocks. 10 am. We called into
Albany which we saw at a disadvantage as it rained all day. In
the distance the hills are ablaze with scrub fires.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">2.30.pm. The Western
Australians disembarked and went into three days quarantine.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 28th 1919.</u></b>
Pulled out at 5.15.pm. As soon as we got out it was very rough.
Everyone had to go through a disinfecting Spray room. It is a
preventative for the Influenza.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 29th and
30th 1919.</u></b> Still rough. Kit inspection at 10 am.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 31st 1919.</u></b>
Very cold. 7 pm. We can see the shore lighthouses.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 1st 1919.</u></b>
Orders are given to hand in all bedding. 7.30 am. We can see land
quite distinctly, even the trees on it. This brings us very near
the end of a long and weary journey. 1 pm. we stopped. Everything
is entirely blotted out by a heavy fog. 3 pm. We can just about
see point Lonsdale. 7 pm. We are moving at last, but lo, it is a
false alarm. 8.30.pm At last we are off again. At 9 pm. we passed
the Heads and proceeded straight to Portsea.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 2nd 1919.</u></b>
The Doctors arrived wearing masks and took the temperature of
every man, and passed an indefinite period of quarantine. This
means a further delay. Every man on board ( Crew and the Captain
included ) has to go through the spray and have his temperature
taken. This means a terrible lot of work for us. The men wearing
masks caused a great amount of amusement but on the whole the
troops are fearfully down hearted and disgusted.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In the afternoon, they
held a mass meeting and demanded from the CO the reason for
quarantine as we have had no illness, whatever on the voyage and
also that Cigarettes be obtained. We got the smokes but no
further satisfaction. In the evening we saw some real Aussie
girls in a Yacht and afterwards had a concert.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 3rd 1919.</u></b>
2 am. Some of the lads lowered the ships dingy and went away. Up
to 9 pm. this boat had not been traced. A troopship
&quot;Marami&quot; landed to day and got a clean sheet so pulled
out half an hour later.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">We had an issue of
apples, chocolate, tinned meat and fruit from the Salvation Army.
No doubt these people are good to us. Later on, a few yachts came
out from Queenscliff and Sorrento but were not allowed to come
anywhere near us.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 4th 1919.</u></b>
It was very hot today. Our restrictions are over today. We are to
pack up ready for disembarkment tomorrow.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 5th 1919.</u></b>
9 am. We landed at the new pier Port Melbourne where we were put
into motors and taken to the Sturt Street Barracks, via Port
Melbourne, South Melbourne, Flinders, Elizabeth, Bourke and
Swanston Streets, which were absolutely lined with crowds of
people who cheered us. Showered us with presents, and wished us
everything good that they could think of.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FF0000" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Anyone
would think we were Heroes and had won the war on our own. The
welcome was such that I never expected to receive, and by far too
good for us.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><strong>At the Barracks
we were finalised and met all our friends and left about 1.30 pm.</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><strong>Practically a
civilian again.</strong></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>Thus
my diary ends after relating some of the most enjoyable,
interesting, and some of the saddest times of my life. One has a
clear conscience though, that he, at least, tried to do a little
for those at home we love better than all the things on this
earth.</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#0000FF" size="4" face="Times New Roman"><b>After
nearly four years I now close this diary and enter civilian life
a very much wiser man, thanks to the Army and to &quot;Kaiser
Bill and his cobbers &quot;</b></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><b>GOODBYE.</b></font></p>
