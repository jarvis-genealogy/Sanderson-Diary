<p align="center"><b><u><font size="7">1917</font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><br>
</font></u></b></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 1st 1917.</u></b> 11 am we marched
to the Wareham Station and entrained for Perham Downs, arriving at that place at 5.30 pm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 2nd,3rd,4th and 5th 1917.</u></b>
Nothing doing but drill. I was on piquet at Flyfield last night. We were today issued with
the remainder of our equipment. Tucker here is cruel, absolutely starvation with out the
option. Here we drill from 8.30 am to noon and 1.30 to 4.30 pm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 6th 1917</u></b>. We went for a
walk to Ludgatshall this afternoon.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 7th 1917.</u></b> A miserable mucky
day and My birthday <b><i>( 20 years old )</i></b> In the afternoon, I went to Tidworth
for a walk.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 8th 1917.</u></b> Drill during day.
After being paid at 6 pm we fell in at 10 pm, marched to Tidworth and entrained for
Folkestone.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 10th 1917.</u></b> Arrived at
Folkestone at 5. am and were marched to the Barracks which, in peace time, were a couple
of fine private hotels. 9 am. Packed up and marched to the boat which left about 11.30 am
and arrived at Calais at 1 pm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">This was an awful trip and I was sick all the
way. On arrival at Calais, we marched to the town which is rather pretty to the
Fontinettes Station where we entrained in cattle trucks for Etaples. ( 40 men to a truck
).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 11th 1917.</u></b> At last we
arrived. ( 4 am ) One man was missing so the Officer started to call the roll. On account
of the terrible ride and being tired the boys have had enough so they counted him out. On
arrival at camp, we had a short sleep in the big mess hut. During the day we were allotted
a tent.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 12th 1917</u></b>. We were here all
day and were warned for the a draft to the front. My word this is sudden.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 13th 1917.</u></b> 6 am. Marched to
Etaples Station and entrained for Albert, arriving there at 11.30 am, taking 5 1/2 hours
to do 70 miles, a marvellous record for the French Railways. On arrival here we were sent
to a rest camp.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 14th 1917.</u></b> 8 am. On the
move again. This time to Ribemont. This is rather a nice place.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 15th 1917.</u></b> It snowed
heavily last night. Had some really great sport snowballing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 16th 1917.</u></b> After we had
wandered round all day we found a nice cosy little billet. About 11 pm the Battalion
arrived, also poor old Reg. He is well and I was pleased to see him.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 17th 1917.</u></b> It is freezing
hard now. What used to be mud and slush is now a hard solid mass.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 18th and 19th 1917.</u></b> We had
drill, like old times.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 20th 1917.</u></b> My mate and I
went to Amiens today. We had a lovely bath and afterwards a fine dinner. Next we visited
the Cathedral. Well this is simply grand, it is beyond all words. The town is much like
Marseilles, but much cleaner and prettier.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">When we landed back we finished the day by going
to the Vaudeville show, run by the Australian Comforts Funds. It was a lovely day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 21st 1917.</u></b> We were today
inspected by General Smythe. He is temporally in command of our Division and is a V.C. ,
real great chap.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 22nd, 23rd, 24th, 25th, 26th, 27th
and 28th 1917.</u></b> It is still freezing, 40 degrees below zero.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 29th 1917.</u></b> We marched to
Becourt today. En route we passed through Becordal, now a mass of ruins.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 30th 1917.</u></b> It is snowing
again. When washing the water just simply freezes in your hair before you have time to
comb it. It freezes on your face also, and if one leaves hot tea for a few minutes he will
find the thinnest of thin crusts of ice on it. This sounds a fairy tale, but you have no
idea how intense the cold is.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">We went for a march up old Sausage Gully this
afternoon and over to the big crater. Where used to be guns and dead is now peaceful and a
big railway running right through it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>January 31st 1917.</u></b> Snowed again
today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 1st 1917.</u></b> Today we moved
up to Cinque Ports at Bazetin le Petit. There is absolutely nothing left of these places
now, especially the famous Delville Wood, now a mere few stumps. This is a bonny little
camp. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 2nd 1917.</u></b> We went over to
have a look at a Tank that had been abandoned. They are formidable looking things all
right. Fritz tries very hard to shell this camp but it is well out of reckoning.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 3rd 1917.</u></b> Still freezing.
All the water in the shell holes has ice 2 or 3 feet deep. We have been having some great
sport skating, sliding etc. This weather over rules all the laws of frost taught us at
school. They say there cannot be a frost when there is a wind. Last night there was a
plentiful supply of both, yet the frost was one of the worst we have had.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 4th 1917.</u></b> We heard today
of America's decision to come into the matter. This will, I think, make a big difference.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 5th 1917.</u></b> We moved off to
Pioneer Camp at Contalmaison.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 6th and 7th 1917.</u></b> Still
freezing. This is getting awful. The cold is terrific.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 8th 1917.</u></b> We moved, via
Martinpuich, to the trenches. All helmets had to be whitened to correspond with the snow,
and when we go out on patrol or to mend our wires ( which is very often of late ) we have
to wear a big white night shirt, right down to our boots. I ask you to imagine me.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 9th 1917.</u></b> Snowed again
last night. I had a look round. In front of our front is what is known at the Butte de
Warlencourt. It overlooks our position and is in his possession, there fore we cannot move
round an inch by day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 10th 1917.</u></b> There was a
very heavy bombardment last night. At last the thaw has set in. It rained heavily during
the night so everything is lovely and muddy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 11th 1917.</u></b> There was a
very heavy fog last night, and this morning we were put on salvage again. It is marvellous
the ammunition and goods being abandoned by Fritz.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 12th 1917.</u></b> Foggy again so
on the same job. We tried to dig a trench. On reaching a depth of six feet, we found the
earth frozen hard. All on top of this is slush about as thick as treacle.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 13th 1917.</u></b> About mid-day
Fritz blew up a big bomb dump of ours and at 4 pm brought down one of our planes. It fell
in a crumpled mass from about 600 feet. When we went across the bodies were in a fearful
state. At8 pm we were relieved and went out to Scotts Redoubt Camp. On the track out we
stopped at the Soup Kitchen. These are run by the Australian Comforts Fund and distribute
a mug of hot coffee, soup or cocoa to the troops as they come out of the trenches.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 14th 1917.</u></b> Was spent in
having a general clean up after last night's wander through about 3 feet of mud.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 15th 1917.</u></b> There was a
tremendous bombardment last night. The floors of the huts shivering even away back here. I
was made a full Corporal today and placed in charge of &quot;D&quot; Company Signallers.
This is &quot;No Bon &quot; at all.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 16th 1917.</u></b> We heard the
result of that big bombardment was very successful.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 17th 1917.</u></b> We shifted to
Acid Drop Camp.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 18th to 21st 1917.</u></b> Nothing
but rain. Today, Reg and I had a look at old Pozieres. It is marvellous to see it now as
it is one mass of huts.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 22nd 1917.</u></b> We moved up the
trenches to the left of Le Sars,it was, on account of the mud, a terrible trip in.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 23rd 1917.</u></b> Quiet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 24th 1917.</u></b> Quiet all day.
At about 8.30 pm we discovered that Fritz was evacuating his trenches in front of us, so
we started to follow him up with patrols.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 25th 1917.</u></b> 1. am The
Battalion moved forward and took Fritz's old front line. He is still on the move. On
arriving in the trench, we found the fires burning in their braziers. Others were already
kindled but on examination we found them to contain sticks of dynamite. There were traps
in every direction.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 26th 1917.</u></b> Moved forward
again last night. We are laying telephone cables all over the place. Tired, I am just
settled. In the afternoon we laid a wire to our forward outpost. Whilst doing this an
aeroplane came quite low and started firing on us. The bullets were landing too close for
my liking. At 8 pm we were relieved to Scotts Redoubt Camp.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 27th 1917.</u></b> We went for a
bath today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>February 28th 1917.</u></b> It was a
glorious day. Another one of our planes was brought down and an enormous ammunition dump
went sky high.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 1st 1917.</u></b> Another lovely day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 2nd 1917.</u></b> Four more big towns
were captured today, or at least, last night. The advance in these parts is still going on
steadily.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 3rd 1917.</u></b> We moved to Cirque
Ports Camp today at Bazentin-le-Petit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 4th 1917.</u></b> We went up to our
old position in front of Warlencourt, Last time we were here this was our front line, now
it is supports.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 5th 1917.</u></b> where we are living
is in a 50 foot dugout and we are quite close to Eaucourt l' Abbye, now absolutely in
ruins.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 6th 1917.</u></b> Snowed heavily
again last night and now the mud is just awful.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 7th 1917.</u></b> Moved again to Gird
Trench ( close supports ) The people from whom we took over, left us with broken lines, so
was out all night fixing these up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 8th 1917.</u></b> We shelled Fritz
terribly all day. Here we have the Butte-de-Warlencourt on our left, La Coupe Geurle in
front, Ligny-Thilloy and Le Barque on our half right. On the Bapaume - Albert Road are the
ruins of a complete Fritz train. The state of the land here and the dead lying round is
terrible.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 9th 1917.</u></b> Snow again last
night. We shelled heavily Loupart Wood. About 3 am this morning a dense fog came up and at
7 pm we moved up to Malt trench ( front line supports ). Owing to the fog the night was as
black as pitch, so we lost our direction. When at last I landed I was mud from head to
foot.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 10th 1917.</u></b> Nothing much doing
today. Four of our aeroplanes were bought down.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 11th 1917.</u></b> Whilst
investigating some old dugouts, we came across a series of old tunnels built for defence
about 100 years ago.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 12th 1917.</u></b> News came today of
the fall of Bagdad. Tres Bon news this. 6 pm we moved to the front line. 9 pm. Discovered
that Fritz was evacuating his trenches in front of us again. We moved forward and captured
Warlencourt trench without any resistance. We are now pushing ahead to try and harass him.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 13th 1917.</u></b> After a lot of
manoeuvring, we got Grevillers, but not without a good few casualties. The people on our
left have captured Loupart Wood. Both these places were taken this time and not
voluntarily evacuated by him. He is putting some fearfully heavy stuff into us now.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 14th 1917.</u></b> We moved back to
supports at Eaucourt L'Abbye.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 15th 1917.</u></b> Marched out to
&quot;6 Camp at Bazentin-le-Grand&quot;. Here every point one looks at is simply
desolation, ruin and graves everywhere.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 16th and 17th 1917.</u></b> Bad news,
up to the lines again. We moved up to Eaucourt L'Abbye. Bapaume and Le Transloy, two of
Fritz's most vulnerable points, fell last night. This is the result of our capture of
Grevilles.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 18th 1917.</u></b> 8 am Moved to Le
Barque, where we stayed till 11 am then moved up to the main Albert - Bapaume Road, via
Bapaume to Favresuil and on until we were stopped, or at least, came in contact with fritz
about Beugnatre. We finally got a check near Vaulx-Vrancourt.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">It is just terrible. These and all the
surrounding villages are in flames and to complete the destruction, a charge of explosives
was put in the cellars of each house. It is a vary pretty sight as every village for miles
around is in flames.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Bapaume was totally destroyed and left in flames.
In fact it is still burning furiously. We are now over three miles past Bapaume. All the
main roads here have big craters in them so as to block traffic, his favourite ruse is to
blow up the intersecting Cross Roads and thus destroy four directions at a time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">All the trees lining the roads have been wilfully
cut down about a foot from the ground and allowed to fall across the roads and buildings.
All the fruit trees have been ringed, thus destroying them forever. Everywhere is wanton
destruction and ruin.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Rumour has it that a big attack has been launched
at Arras.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 19th 1917</u></b>. We ran visual
stations last night. Have been running telephone wires out all over the place. 3 pm Moved
forward about a mile. Reg arrived back from school today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 20th 1917.</u></b> Out all last night
on broken lines. It rained heavens hard so got drenched to the skin. 4 am Moved forward
another mile and launched an attack on the Hun at Ecoust St Longatte.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The other half of the brigade did likewise on
Noreul. This proved to us to be a veritable death trap. It was just bristling with machine
guns, heavy casualties were soon obtained. In fact we could still see the civilian
population leaving town. We had no artillery support save one battery of guns, a little
different to Mouquet Farm where we had 750 odd concentrated on a 250 yard front.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">You can also see from this that Fritz is not
altogether having things his own way, although we were unable to take the village and had
to retire to a point 8 kilometres from Baupaume ( an advance of about one mile on the day
) and looking down into the three villages.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">During the day I got a bullet clean through my
water bottle and lost all my water. 8 pm We were relieved and went out via Baupaume. It is
raining heavens hard and I am dog tired. A couple of us felt the same, and as the town of
Baupaume was still burning and looked warm, we broke away from the Battalion and camped in
one of the buildings which was not on fire, although all around us was on fire. This dried
us and we had the best sleep we have had for weeks.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 21st 1917.</u></b> We followed the
Battalion on to Malt Supports near Le Barque where there is now a camp. A week ago this
place was &quot;No mans land&quot;. Still raining heavily and plenty of mud up to ones
knees.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 22nd 1917.</u></b> We spent the day
in putting duckboard paths and boarding the floors of the tents.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 23rd and 24th 1917</u></b>. Drill and
raining.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 25th 1917.</u></b> Sunday. Had Church
Parade, which was conducted by Captain Chaplain Lambell of St Stephen's Church Richmond.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 26th 1917.</u></b> There was a big
explosion of a timed mine laid by Fritz, in the Baupaume Town Hall last night. At the same
time, the place at Beugnatre in which our headquarters were camped, went up also. We moved
to Mametz Wood Camp, arriving there at 3.30 pm. This camp is on the site of the old town
of Mametz, now completely wiped off the map. The old Church is now marked for guiding
purposes only with a sign board 2 feet by 1 foot &quot; This was Mametz Church &quot; and
the only remains of it is one piece of sandstone.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 27th, 28th and 29th 1917.</u></b>
Terribly cold and snowing. During these days we had parades as usual.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 30th 1917.</u></b> 9.30 am. We moved
via Ericourt ( disappeared ) to Becourt Camp. This is a lovely camp, like a big village
and on the site of what was once Becourt Farm ( now gone ).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>March 31st 1917.</u></b> Went for a walk
into Albert today. Things are just about normal down here now. In the evening we went to
the Vaudeville Theatre run by the Australian Comforts Funds. It was a great show.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 1st 1917.</u></b> Sunday. We had a
big Church Parade and followed by an inspection and presentation of medals by General
Birdwood, then a march past. In the afternoon we went for a bath. These are really insults
to the name. They consist of a 1 pound jam tin with perforated bottoms through which about
a pint of water trickles. One then soaps himself and two minutes after another pint of
water is let loose. If one misses this second lot, he has to wipe the soap off with his
towel. Then a &quot;clean &quot; change of clothes is issued. This really disheartening
because now one has just got rid of all the old &quot; Intruders &quot; out of his shirt (
now 3 to 4 or even 6 weeks old ) so one has to start and exterminate the new breed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 2nd 1917.</u></b> It has turned
awfully cold again.</font></p>

<p><font size="2"><strong><u>April 3rd 1917</u></strong></font><font size="2"
face="Times New Roman">. 8 am. It started to rain again and then snow. In half an hour
everything was covered about 6&quot; deep. Both Reg and I were recommended for our
commissions today, but Reg came out top as he is older than me and is now off to the
school.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 4th 1917.</u></b> Snowed again, even
heavier than yesterday.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 5th 1917.</u></b> A contrast from
yesterday. It was a lovely spring day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 6th 1917.</u></b> Good Friday. The
second in France. It was a glorious day again. Reg left for England today to train for an
Officer. 11 am a squadron of enemy planes came over and bombed positions nearby. Went to
Albert in the afternoon.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 7th 1917.</u></b> Another great day,
close by is a hill. When one stands on it with his back to Albert, in front lies ruin and
behind everything is normal. On one's left is La Boisselle, Ovillers-la-Boisselle,
Pozieres, both Bazentins in front and Mametz, Fricourt and High Wood. On your right,
Becourt Wood is the hill on which you are standing. In the wood here the daffodils,
daisies, lilies and primroses are coming out in great profusion.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 8th 1917.</u></b> Sunday. A big
Church Parade ( Brigade ) was held. I was not to good all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>April 9th 1917.</b> Snowed all day and rained
in between. We were inoculated again.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 10th 1917.</u></b> Snowed again. The
cold is intense. Was off duty all day and in bed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 11th 1917.</u></b> Still feeling very
off colour. Had an exceptionally heavy fall of snow last night, some 12 to 14 inches. We
had some great Fun.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 12th 1917.</u></b> News of the great
Arras push still continues to come through. It is great, some 1100 prisoners and 150 guns.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 13th 1917.</u></b> Moved forward to a
spot near Vaulx-vrau-court, a distance of about 15 miles. We were pretty tired too. When
we stopped in Bapaume, we had a lovely drink at the Australian Comforts Fund. The spot in
which we are at present, is where we were fighting on our last visit. Now it is one mass
of camps.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 14th 1917.</u></b> Spent today in
improving a support line. ( making dugouts etc.) In the evening, we had quite an enjoyable
time with a gramophone supplied by the Australian Comforts Fund.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 15th 1917.</u></b> The Hun this
morning launched a surprise attack on our front line, causing us to evacuate it and a
number of field guns.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Through a very clever manoeuvre of one of our
Colonels, we got behind a couple of Battalions of Huns and cut them off. We fired from
behind with machine guns and in front with field guns ( point blank ).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Some 300 prisoners were taken so you can imagine
the casualties we inflicted on him. There are dead Germans and pieces of him everywhere.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">I was today confirmed a full Corporal. 6 pm. we
moved up to a point North of Vaulx and dug in for the night.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 16th 1917.</u></b> It was awfully
cold all night and day. Fritz shelled us some all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 17th 1917.</u></b> We had an awful
night last night. It rained all night and we got flooded out. So today we moved across to
an old ruined house in Vraucourt, and are now quite comfortable. Shelling was rather heavy
by both sides today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 18th 1917.</u></b> There was a
terrific bombardment all last night. I was very crook all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 19th 1917.</u></b> We are very
comfortable here. We found two walls of a room in an old ruined house with a roof on it.
After a lot of patching we made the remaining two walls complete, and have now fitted up a
table and four chairs ( salvaged from the wreckage ) and a lovely little stove. So things
are homely.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 20th 1917.</u></b> Fritz shelled our
back yard last night. Great news still continues to come from Rheims, where 10,000
prisoners and 100 field guns have been captured.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 21st 1917.</u></b> Fritz gave us a
very heavy bombardment with shrapnel today, so we returned some particular hurry up to
him.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 22nd 1917.</u></b> We went back to
Biefvillers-les-Bapaume today and practiced Manoeuvres. We were very tired when we
returned.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 23rd 1917.</u></b> There was a
terrific bombardment on our left last night. It was a glorious day. Still news of our
repeated successes all along the line continues to come through.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 24th 1917.</u></b> There was a heavy
frost last night, but the day has been beautiful. We had a look round the village today.
It is in a disgraceful state, especially the Church which is completely ruined.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 25th 1917.</u></b> A violent
bombardment took place last night. Artillery was very active all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 26th 1917.</u></b> We moved back to
Favreuil today. Here there is a very large Hun cemetery. From all the crosses he has
scratched the name of the regiment and the date of death so as not to give us any idea of
his casualties.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 27th 1917.</u></b> Reveille at
midnight. We practiced night manoeuvres till 7.30 am and at 9 am returned to Vraucourt.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 28th 1917.</u></b> A terrific
bombardment last night.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 29th 1917.</u></b> We moved to
Biefvillers-les-Bapaume and set up camp.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>April 30th 1917.</u></b> Reveille. We
practiced night manoeuvres till 7 am. This turns out to be practice for a very important
charge we are to make on and around Bullecourt at a very near date. In the afternoon we
went for a walk into Bapaume. 10 pm. we had to move forward to front line supports.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 1st 1917.</u></b> We are now in a
sunken road. ( Not so comfortable as billets eh )</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 2nd 1917.</u></b> All day our
artillery, from 18 pounders to 15 inch pounded Bullecourt, Hendecourt,
Reincourt-les-Cagnicourt and the famous Hindenburg Line all of which we can see quite
plainly from here.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">We are to attack the whole of them tomorrow
morning at 3.45 am. There is to be a big affair and it is on a 15 Division front. About
sunset we brought down a Hun plane. When the occupants were passing us, one who could
speak English, called out to us that they would be waiting for us in the morning. How they
get to know these things I do not know.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 3rd 1917.</u></b> At last a day of
adventures. 1 am. We moved forward to the front line, where we extended at 3 am. and
proceeded to move off across &quot;No man's Land &quot;. Previous to this we had to hand
in all our overcoats, spare gear etc, and go over with two water bottles and bear fighting
equipment with extra ammunition and bombs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">We had not gone across &quot; No Man's Land&quot;
more than 50 yards when Fritz spotted us, our attack was no longer a secret, so he shelled
us terribly, causing terrible casualties.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">3.45 am our bombardment opened accompanied by
Fritz as well. All the furies of hell could not be worse. 4 am. some how or other
something has gone wrong. Instead of being 5th wave we are all mixed up with the 1st wave
and are now in our own as well as Fritz's barrage. Men are literally being wiped out as
they advance. Some blown clean off the earth.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">As the lines advance, they are just dissolving
like ice in front of a fire. We have now reached his wire entanglements which our
artillery has completely destroyed. Casualties are heavy. A few minutes past four. We have
no Officers left. Casualties are increasing and we are now just pouring into the famous
Hindenburg Line. 4.15 am. Getting rather strong resistance. The trench is full of dead
Fritz's.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The English on our left and the Australians on
our right have failed, so our position is precarious, but are holding on and fighting on
all four sides. 7 am. after two hours bombing, we have succeeded in getting him out of a
couple of posts.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">There are 26 of us opposing heaven knows how
many. 7.15 am. Fritz is causing us to retire. Our supply of bombs has given out but more
are on the way.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">An Officer from one of the other Battalions and I
crawled out over the top and took all the bombs and ammunition from the dead and wounded
lying around. We also got a Lewis gun which we are now using against him. As fast as our
men get up to snipe they are killed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Officer has just been killed leaving me in
charge of about 5 men. All the others are killed. Ours is a very important post now as we
are not only protecting the flanks but the whole Battalion from being cut off, also saving
the only means of communication. We are up level with Reincourt ( at out 2nd last
objective ) but do not think it advisable to go any further. 7.30 am We have a new supply
of bombs and about 15 more men and are pounding him with mortars. 7.35 am. He is retiring.
9.30 am Fritz is launching an enormous counter attack on us ( about the sixth since we got
into the trench ) We are sniping and bombing for our lives. The attack seems to be coming
on three sides.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The Australians on our right are recovering and
are now advancing while the Tommies on our left are retiring even from their old front
line, a fine lot these.?</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Noon. The right has failed again but with
persistent and hard fighting are now gaining ground inch by inch. 3.pm. Gas shells are now
being fired at us. Have been rushing round bandaging wounded and putting on their gas
helmets.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Fritz is attacking again. We are now practically
wiped out. 4.30 pm. We have now held this position for 12 hours and have consolidated. We
have succeeded in clearing the old Hun from behind us, so breaking the square and giving
us a path back to Headquarters.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">I have to go back at the orders of an Officer who
has just turned up, to Headquarters with a dispatch and to explain things to the C.O. We
had to go back over the newly captured ground ( over 2300 yards ) where dead and wounded
lying around is something awful.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Fritz is sniping the wounded and stretcher
bearers as they go out. On arrival at Headquarters, I was kept there for a rest. 9 pm.
Fritz is shelling us awfully and the English are retiring on our left. We had to help them
back into their line. Midnight ? The terrific bombardment still continues. How I am living
at the present moment is nothing short of a miracle. All our own guns have opened on us in
response to the S.O.S. signal on our left. The casualties are terrific. We are now under
our own fire and our men are getting our shells from the rear and Fritz's from the front.
We have now about 70 left out of about 1090 men. Our fate now seems inevitable, just to
wait here till we are all finally killed or wounded.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 4th 1917.</u></b> On an average of
about every 1/2 hour our phone wire is being broken and we have to go out to mend it. All
the Headquarters section are gone. We have &quot;Stood To&quot; all night. The men in the
front line were relieved at 4 pm. Out of our 1090 men there are now a full Muster of 53
Officers, N.C.Os and men. Reinforcements are arriving this afternoon.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 5th 1917.</u></b> 2 am. We were
relieved to the Ecoust - Noreul Road Supports. A dispatch from General Head Quarters came
today congratulating us for our brigade was the only one left out of 15 Divisions that had
obtained its objective and held it. 10 pm fritz counter-attacked the front line but lost
heavily.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 6th 1917.</u></b> We stood to all day
today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 7th 1917.</u></b> The Gordons (
Scotties ) attacked Bullecourt today. The bombardment is terrific, but they were
successful. Fritz shelled us all day with 9 inch stuff. 10 pm we were relieved to Faveuil
amidst plenty of rain.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 8th 1917.</u></b> We were drenched to
the skin last night and are still wet. We moved to Le Sars. After arriving here I was
informed that I was to proceed to England on leave.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Heard today that Jim Marshall was killed and
found out after that I buried him. He was blown to bits.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 9th 1917.</u></b> 5 am we walked to
Albert to catch the leave train which left at 2.45 pm and arrived at Boulogne at 11.15 pm.
Whilst passing through Amiens we saw some refugees from Lens. The country side is looking
great in its spring hue now.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 10th 1917.</u></b> We stayed the night
in rest Billets and at 10.15 am caught the boat which left at 11 am and arrived at
Folkestone at 1 pm. En Route, we were escorted, along with hospital ships, by destroyers
and a dirigible balloon. From Folkestone we took the train and arrived in London at 4 pm.
After a bath and a brush we went to the Criterion Theatre in Piccadilly to see &quot; A
Little Bit of Fluff&quot;. It was great.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 11th 1917.</u></b> Took my mate to see
the Abbey, Houses of Parliament, and a general tour around. In the evening we went to see
&quot;Three Cheers&quot; Harry Lauder's Revue. It was not bad and he was much better in
this than he was in Australia. At 11 pm. we caught the train for Edinburg. It was very
crowded.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 12th 1917.</u></b> Arrived at 7 am.
Spent the day touring round. In the evening we went to see &quot;Goldman's Ltd&quot; at
the Theatre Royal &quot;. This is supposed to be the best show here. All I say is heaven
help the worst. &quot;Nuf sed&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 13th 1917</u></b>. We took a taxi for
the day ( Three pound ten shillings and seven pence ) and toured round all the suburbs and
hills. Such scenery I have never in all my life seen. No wonder they call it &quot;Bonny
Scotland&quot; 10.pm. caught the train for London.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 14th 1917.</u></b> Arrived London 6.30
am. During my wanderings I met some chaps I knew. They are now Officers. Being old mates
they made me go up and stay with them at their place of abode, the Carlton Hotel no less,
one of the highest in London. Here one is waited on from head to feet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In the evening we went to see &quot;Cheep&quot; a
Revue at the Vaudeville Theatre.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 15th 1917.</u></b> We all took a taxi
through the St. James Park. It was a lovely sight and drive. One place here, the Queen
Victoria Monument in front of Buckingham Palace, is very interesting because on your left
is Piccadilly, then comes Pall Mall, Trafalgar Square, Charing Cross, Westminster and
Victoria, all forming a half circle around you.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In the evening we saw Gaby Deslys in
&quot;Suzette&quot; at the Globe Theatre. It was lovely. Afterwards we returned to the
hotel for supper.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 16th 1917.</u></b> A surprise of
surprises, I met Jim Wiles today at A.I.F. Headquarters. We went round all over the place
together. Dining and lunching at the Maison Lyons. In the evening we went to &quot;Chu
Chin Chow&quot; at his Majestys.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 17th 1917.</u></b> Got my photos today.
It rained all day so my friends and I spent a day at home on the Music Room at the Carlton
where I am staying tonight. In the evening after having dinner we attended the Royal Opera
at the Garrick Theatre and saw the &quot;Tales of Hoffman &quot;. It was great.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 18th 1917</u></b>. Spent a very fine
day in going out to see Mrs. Morison at Southgate. She gave us a very nice time. We have
an invitation to their place on Sunday so am seriously thinking of accidentally missing
the train. Tomorrow I am going to a banquet at the Savoy Hotel. Had a great time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 19th 1917.</u></b> This afternoon we
visited the Kew Gardens. They are Tres bon. Quite enjoyed myself. In the night I was at a
dinner held by a few of my old mates from Australia and who had all met in London.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 20th 1917.</u></b> I accidentally
missed the train this morning so had another day in London. In the afternoon we went out
to Mrs. Morisons and had a real enjoyable time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 21st 1917.</u></b> Caught the 6.50 am
train for Folkestone where we waited all day till 3 pm when we caught the boat to Boulogne
without any excitement arriving there at 5 pm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 22nd 1917.</u></b> 8 am Caught the
train to Etaples where we waited in camp for the rest of the day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 23rd 1917.</u></b> 4.15 am we caught
the train to Albert arriving there about 3 pm and walked to where the Battalion was
billeted at Millencourt, a very pretty little village.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 24th 1917.</u></b> Oh ! What a
difference, that infernal drill again. The scenery around here is lovely. We are in a
hollow surrounded by trees and cultivated hills. The weather is A.1.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 25th 1917.</u></b> Marched to Senlis
for a bath this morning and drill in the afternoon.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 26th 1917.</u></b> We had a rifle
competition this morning. All the prizes came to our company. In the evening I walked
across to Bouzincourt to see about Jim Marshall.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 27th 1917.</u></b> Church Parade in the
morning and Oh! today we had a fine dinner, quite a change for the army. Roast beef (very
red in the centre) roast potatoes ( Hard 1/4 inch from the skin ) boiled something, I
think it was called cabbage; anyhow we will let it go at that and a rice pudding at least
1 inch black from the bottom of the Dixie. In the afternoon we played the Cyclist Corps
football and got beaten.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 28th 1917.</u></b> Battalion sports
today. It was very hot but had a good time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 29th 1917.</u></b> Very Cool.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 30th 1917.</u></b> Cool again. I was
Regimental Orderly Sergeant for the day. The remainder of the Battalion had a sports
meeting and a game of football. Once more we were beaten.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>May 31st 1917.</u></b> Just plain and
simple drill.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 1st 1917.</u></b> Oh! Eureka ! Broke
for a week and got paid today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 2nd 1917.</u></b> We walked into
Warloy this evening. It is pretty place but a long way.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 3rd 1917.</u></b> Played the 24th
Battalion football and got licked, 5 points to 21.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 4th 1917.</u></b> Marched to a
neighbouring river ( Ancre ) and had a dip. Tres Bon too.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 5th 1917.</u></b> It has been hot all
day. In the afternoon we had a thunderstorm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 6th 1917.</u></b> Some more of those
infernal manoeuvres at the scene of those awful battles of Theipval, a distance of 8
miles. It was a march too and as hot as possible.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Just past Albert the ground is all one immense
swamp just filled with skeletons of Germans who were drowned when the British and French
broke the banks of the canal in 1914, thus saving Albert but flooding old Fritz out.
Around Theipval there are dozens of corpses and skeletons still lying in the shell holes.
It is an awful disgrace.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 7th 1917.</u></b> The most violent
thunderstorm I have ever experienced broke over us at about 1 am. There is a bombardment
going on up the line. News of the great Messines push came today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 8th 1917.</u></b> The heavy
bombardment still continues. We had a day at the rifle range. This work is most tiring.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 9th 1917.</u></b> Drill again.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 10th 1917.</u></b> We had a couple of
terrific thunderstorms again today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 11th 1917.</u></b> News from Ypres
still comes through very good.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 12th 1917.</u></b> A heavy bombardment
last night and a thunderstorm by day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 13th 1917.</u></b> Night manoeuvres.
We took the village in which we are billeted. Only one casualty, a man ran into an old
draft horse and sustained a black eye.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 15th 1917.</u></b> Marched to
Varrenness, a distance of 10 miles. On arriving there we found the Hun had blown up the
line so had to wait till 5 pm when we entrained for Bapaume, arriving at 8 pm. Then we
marched to Reincourt-les-Bapaume near Villers-au-Flos. We are now under canvas.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 14th 1917.</u></b> Marched to Avelouy,
5 miles from here and had a bath in the lake. It was lovely.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 16th 1917.</u></b> Oh! The joyful
news. I was today informed that I was to proceed to Blighty ( England ) for 6 months on
the staff.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 17th 1917.</u></b> 5 am. Walked about
2 miles to Bapaume where I got a lift on a motor transport convoy to Albert, about 19
kilos. When passing through the remains of Le Sars. A Taube dropped a bomb on the convoy,
killing and completely destroying two motor lorries. 2 pm. caught the train for Bolougne
arriving about 6 pm. and walked up one of the steepest hills to St. Martin's Wireless
Camp. I can tell you it was hot too.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 18th 1917.</u></b> We are still
waiting here. Had a terrible storm all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 19th 1917.</u></b> Caught boat to
Folkestone and then train to London.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 20th 1917.</u></b> Wandered at large
round London and went to the Opera &quot;Louise&quot; in the evening.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 21st 1917.</u></b> Proceeded to
Amesbury and then by car to Rollestone Camp, an awfully out of the way place.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 22nd 1917.</u></b> Nothing doing,
nobody loves us yet. Went to the pictures in the evening.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 23rd 1917.</u></b> Still having a
holiday.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 24th 1917.</u></b> This morning we
walked over to Stonehenge and witnessed the only Service held each year. In the afternoon
we walked across to Figheldean, where there still exists the old chestnut tree so world
famed in &quot;The Village Blacksmith&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 25th 1917.</u></b> Even here we got
that infernal drill.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 26th 1917.</u></b> Walked across to
Shrewton. This is not a bad little village.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 27th 1917.</u></b> We set out for
Weymouth, arriving there about 5pm. After a brief walk round, we went out to the school of
Instruction at Wyke Regis.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 28th 1917.</u></b> It is very pretty
out here. One can see Portland Island at one end of which is a big boat on the rocks.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 29th 1917.</u></b> Had an examination
today, came out fairly well.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>June 30th 1917.</u></b> Went into Weymouth.
It is great here. The Promenade is the best I have seen.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 1st 1917.</u></b> To Weymouth again.
In the evening we went to the Garden Pavilion, there a glorious orchestra rendered some
very classical Music. It was a glorious night.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 2nd 1917.</u></b> Very hot.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 3rd 1917.</u></b> There was some very
heavy firing at sea.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 4th 1917.</u></b> Went to look at the
Wyke Regis Church. It is very pretty and was the one attended by Royalty when this was the
Royal Watering Place. The chimes are really worthy of mention.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 5th 1917.</u></b> Lovely day. Nothing
doing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 6th 1917.</u></b> Walked over to
Portland and Chisel Beach. The wreckage here is terrible. Collections of boats that have
been smashed for years.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 7th 1917.</u></b> Walked to Weymouth.
A lovely day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 8th 1917.</u></b> We took a couple of
boats and went for a row. Quite an enjoyable afternoon.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 9th 1917.</u></b> Drill again as
usual.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 10th 1917.</u></b> Went across to
Portland. Since the big tidal wave this is no longer an island, because of the sand bank
thrown up. A railway and road now run across. Portland was a big convict settlement and
has enormous Quarries.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 11th 1917.</u></b> Again there was
heavy firing out at sea.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 12th and 13th 1917.</u></b>
Examinations today. Did well.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 14th and 15th 1917.</u></b> Had the
week end in Weymouth. Quite an enjoyable time. Took a motor boat and went for quite a long
spin.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 16th and 17th 1917.</u></b>
Examinations. ( Final ) So far am going strong.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 18th 1917.</u></b> A dense fog today,
lasting till 3 pm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 19th 1917.</u></b> Exams. Still going
strong.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 20th 1917.</u></b> A big boat with a
lot of our mail was wrecked near here today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 21st 1917.</u></b> It turned out that
the boat yesterday was torpedoed.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 22nd 1917.</u></b> Spent the day in
Weymouth. In the morning we attended the service at the Wyke Regis Church. It has a lovely
choir.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 23rd 1917.</u></b> One of our men got
the measles so we were all isolated.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 24th 1917.</u></b> Walked over to see
&quot;Sandsfoot Castle&quot;. It is very pretty and hundreds of years old and now in ruins</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 25th 1917.</u></b> Stayed in camp all
day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 26th 1917.</u></b> In the evening went
to the Gardens in Weymouth and saw the &quot;Sequins&quot; Concert Party.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 27th 1917.</u></b> Spent the day in
cleaning up to return to Rollestone.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 28th 1917.</u></b> We returned to
Rollestone. Raining again.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 29th 1917.</u></b> Stayed in all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 30th 1917.</u></b> Rain, Rain again.
Did nothing, saw nothing and stopped in all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>July 31st 1917.</u></b> Ah ! Furlough.
10am. Went to Amesbury, caught the train to London. It still rains. I am stopping at
Strand Palace Hotel, the Strand, London. In the evening, saw &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot; at
His Majesty's.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 1st 1917.</u></b> Caught the 11 pm
train to Edinburg, arrived at 7.30 am.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 2nd 1917.</u></b> The weather is
lovely. Caught the 3.15 pm. train to Aberdeen. The journey up here is lovely. It takes
four hours. The line runs along the coast and the sea is constantly in view.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">We passed through mines without ends; then
cuttings; then tunnels then on the top of a cliff, then into a tunnel again. The rocks on
the coast are very rugged. There are enormous towering brown rocks with the ocean breaking
into spray all over them. Islands, large and small are of every conceivable shape, some
flat and some like great needles towering out into the sea.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Then on the other side great hills, even
mountains rise up. Oh ! it is lovely. We pass over the world famous Firth of Forth Bridge,
( The Firth was full of war vessels ) over the Tay Bridge and through Dundee, finally
landing at Aberdeen, a very much wiser and tired man.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">I stayed at the Palace Hotel. In the evening I
went to the best theatre there. Well, if this is the best, all I can say is , heaven help
the worst.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 3rd 1917.</u></b> Had a good wander
round. Everything is built of grey granite. It has a curious and most glorious effect. 2
pm. Caught the train to Loch Lomond. It was a most interesting ride to Glasgow.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 4th 1917.</u></b> Went to that
heaven on earth, Loch Lomond. Oh ! of all the places I have seen, this is the best. No
words will ever describe it. 6 pm. Caught the train to London.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 5th 1917.</u></b> Arrived in London.
6 am. Very tired. I went out to see Mrs. Morrison today. Had quite a nice day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 6th 1917.</u></b> Bank Holiday, a
great day in London. In the morning we took a taxi to Hamstead Heath. I never in all my
life saw such a crowd. All the Cockneys, 'Arries and 'Ariets with their merry go rounds
and the like. In the afternoon we went to Hyde Park and oh the crowd there, all sorts of
shapes and sizes.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">In the evening we went to see the great play
&quot;Romance&quot; in which Doris Kean has made such a hit. It was some thing glorious. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 7th 1917.</u></b> Had a glorious day
round London in general. In the evening went to the Savoy Theatre and afterwards to the
Savoy for supper.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 8th 1917.</u></b> In the evening
went out to my mate's Place at Waddon, near Croydon. Had a real good evening. Spent the
afternoon at the Kew Gardens, where we got some fine photos..</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 9th 1917.</u></b> This morning we
went out to view Windsor Castle. It was very fine indeed, the scenery is great. The
Alhambra Theatre was on the books for the evening where we saw Violet Lorraine in
&quot;Round the Map&quot;, a lovely performance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 10th 1917.</u></b> The inevitable
has happened. Leave is over so we returned to camp to hear that we had all passed for our
Instructor's Certificates, the highest an N.C.O. can get.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 11th 1917.</u></b> Spent the
afternoon developing the photos of our leave. Went to the pictures in the evening.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 12th 1917.</u></b> Went for a walk
to Amesbury and then home again through Lark Hill. Rained all the way.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 13th and 14th 1917.</u></b> Drill as
usual.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 15th 1917.</u></b> Had a fearful
rainstorm today. In less than 15 minutes, the lower parts of the camp were flooded about 6
feet deep in water.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 16th and 17th 1917,</u></b> Drill.
Nothing worth noting.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 18th 1917.</u></b> Nothing doing all
day, raining. Went to the camp Vaudeville Show in the evening. Just about passable.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 19th 1917.</u></b> Walked across to
Bulford this afternoon. It was a very pretty walk.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 20th 1917.</u></b> The Duke of
Connaught reviewed out troops today, taking the whole of the day waiting for him.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 21st 1917.</u></b> News came through
of the success at Len, Ypres, Verdun and Italy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 22nd, 23rd and 24th 1917.</u></b>
Drill as usual.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 25th 1917.</u></b> All had to move
into tents until huts were fumigated.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 26th 1917.</u></b> Went down to
Rollestone Manor today. It is a fine old place. The people were fine too.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 27th 1917.</u></b> A small batch of
reinforcements arrived today. They were a scraggy looking lot too.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 28th and 29th 1917.</u></b> Drill.
Nothing worthy of mention.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 30th 1917.</u></b> We all moved back
into the huts today. It is warmer here I can tell you.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>August 31st 1917.</u></b> Received a big
mail today. We received word that an out going and an incoming mail was sunk.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 1st 1917.</u></b> Went for a walk
to Winterborne-Stoke. This is a very pretty little village.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 2nd 1917.</u></b> The Anniversary
of the <b>&quot;Southland&quot;</b> We went down to Rollestone Manor, and Church in the
evening.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 3rd 1917.</u></b> Nothing doing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th 1917.</u></b>
I have been ill all this time. A touch of that trench fever again. It's rotten, I can tell
you.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 8th 1917.</u></b> Took a slow
walk to Tilshead ( about 8 miles ) This is the quaintest little village I have struck.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 9th 1917.</u></b> Rollestone
Manor in the afternoon. Had a good time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 10th 1917.</u></b> Every sign of
Autumn is now evident. Temperatures are lowering ( not that they are ever very high ) and
the glorious shades of the trees and plants is really worthy of a mention.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 11th and 12th 1917.</u></b>
Raining and cold.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 13th and 14th 1917.</u></b>
Drill.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 16th 1917.</u></b> Walked across
to Figheldean. I described this place last visit.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 17th to 21st 1917.</u></b> Lovely
week, but nothing to report other <b><u>than drill as usual.</u></b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 22nd 1917.</u></b> Spent the
afternoon in the Cathedral, City of Salisbury. It is a very old and quaint place, but the
Cathedral is very fine. It ranks among the most historic of England. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The spire is the second highest and it boasts of
being the only Cathedral entirely built in the one period. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">It is really a majestic and massive style. This
is built after the style of Amiens Cathedral.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 23rd 1917.</u></b> Stayed home
all day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 24th 1917.</u></b> Got a lot of
letters from home and from the boys in France. They have been in the recent Ypres stunts,
which must have been marvellous. Saw Jim Wiles today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 25th 1917.</u></b> There are
rumours that we are going to move from this camp.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 26th to 29th 1917.</u></b> There
has been one continual fog these days. It has not even lifted for an hour.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>September 30th 1917.</u></b> Spent the day
at the Manor and wandered through their beautiful orchard. There was fruit in any
quantity.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 1st and 2nd 1917.</u></b> Nothing
doing.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 3rd 1917.</u></b> The Head Sig.
Major &quot;Some one &quot; came and inspected us today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 4th 1917.</u></b> We had a very
violent storm today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 5th 1917.</u></b> News of another
big push at Ypres. My word our boys have paid the penalty this time. They are nearly all
gone.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 6th 1917.</u></b> Went to Lark Hill
Cinema in the evening.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 7th 1917.</u></b> Spent the day at
the Manor. This is our second home. Had an awful storm which lasted for 12 hours.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 8th 1917.</u></b> I was detailed to
attend a school of Instruction at Boyton near Codford, a very pretty village. I left
Amesbury at 10 am and after changing several trains landed there at 6 pm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 9th 1917.</u></b> Rained all day.
This place is completely surrounded with steep hills and is very pretty.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 10th 1917.</u></b> Very cold and
frosty.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 11th 1917.</u></b> Very cold and
frosty.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 12th 1917.</u></b> Still cold. Had
the exam today. I got 99%. Excellent paper.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 13th 1917.</u></b> Our camp has
been shifted so today I had to find them at Fovant ( about 2 miles from Dinton ) Oh! the
scenery is just lovely. We are in a basin with a heavy wood in the rear and enormous hills
round us.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">These hills are of chalk and every unit that has
been here has cut their badge in the side of the hill by removing the green turf and
filling up with white chalk. The Australian one is built on the scale of being 1,000 times
bigger than our hat badge. Then there is a map of Australia twice the area of this big
badge. They are a real work of art. In the evening we walked down to the Vaudeville at
Hurdcott.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 14th 1917.</u></b> Walked over to
Breadchalk, a pretty village, with a lovely old Church. We attended here in the evening.
The village is built in a hollow and wooded hills all round</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">When the Church bells chime, it is with
marvellous effect. It sounds as if hundreds of bells were ringing at the one time.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 15th to 19th 1917.</u></b> Nothing
exciting doing. Drill as usual.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 20th 1917.</u></b> There was a
terrible air raid in London last night. One bomb dropped right on Piccadilly.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 21st and 22nd 1917.</u></b> Quiet
today. Drill as usual.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 23rd 1917.</u></b> News came of the
downing of five of the Zepps that raided London. Also of another big push at Flanders.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 24th and 25th 1917.</u></b> Nothing
of importance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 26th 1917.</u></b> I went to London
for the weekend and stayed at The Howard Hotel, Strand. I saw &quot;Theodore and Co&quot;,
the musical comedy. It was lovely.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 27th 1917.</u></b> Went round to
Piccadilly to see where the bomb dropped last week. It made a big hole in the middle of
the road and broke every pain of glass for a radius of 200 yards. No property was very
much damaged. In the evening we went to the Alhambra and again &quot;Round the map&quot;.
It has been altered somewhat.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 28th 1917.</u></b> Round London in
general. Spent Sunday in the Rotten Row, some style, eh? Caught the 4.05 pm train back to
camp arriving at11.45 pm.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>October 29th to 31st 1917.</u></b> Nothing
of importance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 1st 1917.</u></b> My arm has again
broken out where I was wounded. It is a source of constant annoyance.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 2nd 1917.</u></b> We had our
school photographed today. Rumour says we are going back to France next week.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 3rd 1917.</u></b> Camp closed. A
general mobilisation of all troops in camp have been ordered. So everything is upside
down. The Italian retreat still continues. War news in general is very poor except on the
French front, where the enemy has retired 1,000 yards.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 4th 1917.</u></b> Everything is
ready for emergencies. All standing by waiting. Noon. All restrictions have been lifted.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 5th to 9th 1917.</u></b> Nothing
of importance. Very wet and cold.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 10th 1917.</u></b> Stayed home and
did some photos. In the evening went to a Vaudeville Show.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 11th 1917.</u></b> Took a walk to
Tisbury ( 5 miles distant ) of all the walks I have been, this is one of the prettiest.
The roads lead over a series of small hills which form the basin of three enormous ranges
of very high hills. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">The whole of this country side is dotted with
clumps of forest, trees and numerous roads leading in all directions. Then on top of the
highest of these, smaller hills lies Tisbury. Autumn which is now at hand has lent one of
the most beautiful schemes. The sides of the roads and hedges are lined with lovely
colored berries and ferns of all descriptions, stag and many others, we prize and doctor
up.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 12th 1917.</u></b> Quiet today.
Had a lovely sunset tonight. everyone was out to see it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 13th to 16th 1917.</u></b> Been
very busy preparing a big squad for the final classification.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 17th 1917.</u></b> Took a car into
Salisbury and had a grand day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 18th 1917.</u></b> Walked up to
Dinton, a village four miles from here, had tea and returned home.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 19th 1917.</u></b> Quiet today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 20th 1917.</u></b> Held a meeting
tonight to decide on a proper and big mess for the Headquarters N.C.O.'s. It promises to
be a great success.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 21st 1917.</u></b> News came
through of the great push between St Quentin and the River Scarpe. Already we have
advanced 5 miles on a 36 mile front. Operations continue so the communique says.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 22nd to 27th 1917.</u></b> These
days have been very stormy with fearful gales.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 28th 1917.</u></b> The news of the
Cambrai Battle comes through. It is hourly getting worse.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>November 29th and 30th 1917.</u></b>
Nothing to report.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 1st 1917.</u></b> Went to the
Vaudeville Show tonight. Had rather a decent day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 2nd 1917.</u></b> Did some
photography.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 3rd 1917</u></b>. Very cold.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 4th 1917</u></b>. Still cold. Our
new mess opened today. It is some class.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 5th 1917.</u></b> There was a
terrible frost last night. It tried to snow today.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 6th 1917.</u></b> The awful
struggle around Cambrai still continues.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 7th 1917.</u></b> Reports still
come through re this awful struggle. Seems to be getting worse.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 8th 1917.</u></b> Still wet. News

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 13th and 14th 1917</u></b>. Very
quiet.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 15th 1917.</u></b> Went across to
Tisbury. Had a lovely day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 16th 1917.</u></b> We awoke to
find it raining and blowing. At 10 am it started to snow, and within half an hour was
6&quot; deep. In the afternoon it turned into a terrible blizzard.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 17th 1917.</u></b> Cold and snowed
again.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 18th 1917.</u></b> We were
skating, or at least trying to, on a nearby pond, which had 23&quot; of ice on it.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 19th and 20th 1917.</u></b> Heavy
frost and fog this morning. One cannot see more than three yards in front of him. It did
not lift all day.</font></p>

today. Fog still continues.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 22nd 1917.</u></b> It rained today
so at least we have got rid of the snow.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 23rd 1917.</u></b> Frost again.
Everything is as hard as iron.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 24th 1917.</u></b> Cold and work
as usual. We had a grand concert party here tonight. </font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 25th 1917.</u></b> Xmas Day. And a
day it was too, cold but lovely. We did not get out of bed till 11 am. After dressing we
went down to the mess for dinner. The tables were gloriously decorated and layed. Cost
about 10 pounds to do it and only seat 40 persons. We sat down at 1.30 pm, After a nice
address by the Commandant and waded though an eight course dinner, after which we toasted
all to be toasted.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">Finally rising from the table at 4.30 pm, some
going eh? This is not all. At 6 pm we started off again and had a three course tea. The
manager of the Vaudeville Theatre ( he was invited to dinner ) reserved the first three
rows in his Theatre. It was a present from him to us for the good time we had given him.
The show was lovely, so in return we invited the whole Company of Artists to our mess for
supper and evening. Supper was served at 9.30 pm during which time we had songs and
dances, after each course ( 6 in all ). Finally at 1 am we all retired after having a
glorious day.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 26th 1917.</u></b> Boxing Day. We
arose at 10 am and made a cup of cocoa and then went down to lunch. In the afternoon we
took the Vaudeville Artists ( very nice people) to the sports. It was awfully cold so we
bought them back to the mess where we had a nice musical afternoon and dinner at 5.30 pm.
Also they invited us to the performance which was a change of programme in the way of
songs.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">They came in again at 9.30 pm for supper. We had
a dance and musical evening. Then the party broke up at midnight, tired but happy.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 27th 1917.</u></b> At noon I got
leave for 6 days to London, and arrived there at 3.30 pm. Went with my pal out to his
place at Croydon and in the evening to the local Theatre, the Palace. A lovely place and
saw the pantomime the &quot;Sleeping Beauty &quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 28th 1917.</u></b> Had a look over
the Interior of Parliament to day. The carving was some thing to be proud of. In the
evening went to see the &quot;Maid of the Mountain &quot; at Daly's Theatre, which is one
of the prettiest I have seen. It is all inlaid cedar.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 29th 1917.</u></b> Wandered round
London in general for a good look round. In the evening went to see &quot;Pamela&quot; at
the Palace. This is a beautiful piece. Had supper at the Trocadero, the best in London.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 30th 1917.</u></b> Cold and wet.
At about 4 pm. one of London's black fogs came down on the city. It is astounding the
density of it. The street lamps are of no use whatever and one has to grope round in pitch
blackness. You have no idea of it. Went out to Mrs. Morrison's today and this greeted us
on our return.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b><u>December 31st 1917.</u></b> We woke up to
find the roofs and all were covered with snow. Had a look at the Royal Albert Hall. It is
enormous place. It seats about 8 to 10,000 people and there are boxes galore.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">It has one of the finest pipe organs in the
