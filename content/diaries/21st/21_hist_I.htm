      <P align=justify>After the departure of the first Australian Division and 
      the Fourth A.I. Brigade from Australia in 1914, the depots in the 
      different States rapidly assumed unwieldy proportions. More men were 
      offering their services than were needed to reinforce the troops already 
      in the field, and in March 1915 it was decided to form three new Infantry 
      Brigades, the 5<SUP>th</SUP>, 6<SUP>th</SUP>, 7<SUP>th</SUP>, and a Light 
      Horse Brigade, the 4<SUP>th</SUP>. The 3<SUP>rd</SUP> L.H. Brigade had 
      embarked in February 1915.</P>
      <P align=justify>The 21<SUP>st</SUP>, 22<SUP>nd</SUP>, and 23<SUP>rd</SUP> 
      Battalions of the 6<SUP>th </SUP>Infantry Brigade were at once formed in 
      Victoria. The 24<SUP>th</SUP> Battalion was originally composed of South 
      Australians, and was not formed as a Victorian unit until a week before we 
      sailed.</P>
      <P align=justify>The 21<SUP>st</SUP> Battalion was made up of "L" to "S" 
      Companies from the Infantry Depot at Broadmeadows, together with 250 men 
      from the Light Horse Depot. During the last week of March the Brigade was 
      officially handed over to the Brigadier, Col. R. Linton, and went to live 
      in it’s new camp at the Eastern end of the old depot. The command of the 
      21<SUP>st</SUP> Battalion was entrusted to Lt-Col. J. F. Hutchinson, with 
      Major E. A. Harris as Second in Command, and Capt. F. W. D. Forbes as 
      Adjutant. The Company commanders were; "A" Maj. C. H. Raitt: "B" Maj. W. 
      J. Batemen; "C" Lt. N. F. Wellington; "D" Lt. B. O. C. Duggan. Of these 
      officers Capt Forbes and Lt Duggan later commanded the 21<SUP>st</SUP> 
      Battalion, while Maj. Harris was transferred to command the 
      59<SUP>th</SUP> Battalion and Maj. Bateman to command the19th 
      Battalion.</P>
      <P align=justify>During April the Battalion was organised and trained as a 
      unit; transport, machine gun, and signalling sections were formed, and the 
      troops shook down into the happy family life, which lasted throughout our 
      career. From those early days the 21<SUP>st</SUP> was the only unit as far 
      as we were concerned, and the spirit of the original members spread itself 
      through all those who joined us later on. The first week of May was spent 
      in frenzied attempts to equip the Battalion, and to weed out the unfit. 
      Both attempts were successful, and on 8<SUP>th</SUP> May, 1915, we left 
      Broadmeadows at midday, to embark on H.M.A.T. "Ulysses" lying at the Town 
      Pier, Port Melbourne.</P>
      <P align=justify>Embarkation was quietly carried out. There was no fanfare 
      of trumpets, and that night we slipped from the pier down the bay in 
      company with the "Euripides" which carried the 23<SUP>rd</SUP> and 
      24<SUP>th</SUP> Battalions. On our boat, besides ourselves, there were 
      Brigade H. Q. and the 22<SUP>nd</SUP> Battalion. Troopship life was 
      strenuous. Like the rest of the A.I.F., we lived on troop decks, sleep in 
      hammocks, grumbled at the food, and between time wrote home. Parades were 
      held at 7 am for "jerks", 10 till 12, and 2 till 4 for General 
      Instruction. The groundwork obtained during these parades in musketry and 
      the theoretical part of soldiering enabled us to start work in Egypt in a 
      fairly advanced stage of training.</P>
      <P align=justify>The sea was smooth throughout the trip. The main 
      incidents were out visit to Colombo, the subsequent trouble over the 
      punishment of absentees, and finally the glorious trip through the Suez 
      Canal in daylight. Here we saw troops on active service for the first 
      time, as the "line" was then right on the Canal bank.</P>
      <P align=justify>On arrival at Alexandria, at 2 pm on 8<SUP>th</SUP> June, 
      most of the troops took French leave for the evening. Next day we 
      entrained for Helmieh Siding, thence we marched to the Aerodrome Camp, 
      Heliopolis, which was our home for the next three months.</P>
      <P align=justify>Our first stay in Egypt is one of our happiest memories. 
      In spite of the heat and the not too good tucker, we enjoyed our time off 
      thoroughly. Hard training in the early mornings and the evenings kept us 
      very fit. Heliopolis was just next door to our camp, and Cairo 20 minutes 
      by electric train, and the sights, sounds and smells of our new 
      surroundings interested us. We worked through the individual and 
      collective stages of training rapidly, and spent most of July doing 
      Battalion and Brigade exercises on the desert. Junior Officers and senior 
      N.C.O’s underwent a course at the Zeitoun School, which had beneficial 
      effects upon our efficiency.</P>
      <P align=justify>In July, the 5<SUP>th</SUP>, 6<SUP>th</SUP>, and 
      7<SUP>th</SUP> Brigades were formed into the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Australian 
      Division under Maj.-Gen. Legge, who was bought from Gallipoli to take 
      charge. Engineer companies and signallers were drawn from the Infantry and 
      trained with us. The 13<SUP>th</SUP> Light Horse was detached as 
      Divisional Cavalry, but we had no artillery and did not get any until 
      after our return from the Peninsula.</P>
      <P align=justify>From 12<SUP>th</SUP> to 23<SUP>rd</SUP> August "C" 
      Company garrisoned the Cairo Citadel, the other three companies, 
      Kasr-el-Nil and Bab-el-Hadid Barracks in the city it self. We were the 
      first Australian troops to act as garrison in Cairo.</P>
      <P align=justify>On returning to Heliopis we absorbed our 1<SUP>st</SUP> 
      and 2<SUP>nd</SUP> reinforcements, which brought us to full strength, and 
      on the night of the 29<SUP>th</SUP> August entrained at Helmieh Siding 
      once more as a fully trained Australian unit ready to take our place at 
      the side of the 1<SUP>st</SUP> Division which had already made its name 
      immortal on Gallipoli.</P>
      <P align=justify>The 5<SUP>th</SUP> Inf Bde had proceeded us by a week and 
      even while we were entraining was taking part in the last effort which was 
      made to cross the Gallipoli Peninsula and open the Dardenelles to our 
      fleet.</FONT></P>
