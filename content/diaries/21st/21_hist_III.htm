    <td width="100%">&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We arrived at Tel-el-kebir in the midst
    of the first rain storm we had experienced in Egypt and found that the few tents on our
    camping ground were occupied by our 4<sup>th</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and part of our 6<sup>th</sup>
    reinforcements. After a few days when we had sorted ourselves out we found that we were in
    camp alongside the 1<sup>st</sup> Division. Both Divisions were complete with artillery,
    engineers and all division troops for the first time, our own divisional artillery and
    engineers having arrived from Australia to join us.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Battalion stayed at Tel-el-kebir training till the 25<sup>th</sup>
    January when the Division moved out to take over the Canal Zone defences. We travelled by
    train to Ismailia---Moasar and marched to Ferry Post. Next day we marched from Ferry Post
    to our defensive position near Hog'&#146; Back, ten miles in a straight line. After
    consultation with some who took part in most of our marches, the writer unhesitatingly
    puts this down as the worst &quot;promenade&quot; we ever did. Every man was fully
    equipped with extra ammunition, rations and two blankets in addition to the ordinary
    Etceteras. When we reached the end the &#145;Q&#146; department had failed and we solaced
    ourselves on Bully beef, biscuits and very little water. And all this in the heat of the
    Egyptian sun; yes it was some march.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Routine on the Sinai&#146;s Desert was strenuous. Training occupied out
    time by day, and one night in four each company had a run on outpost duty. We owed a great
    deal of our efficiency in France to the six weeks spent guarding the Canal. In February
    the Brigade Machine Gun Company was formed and the Battalion M.G. Officer and Sergeant
    attended a course of Lewis Gunnery at Ismailia.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leaving the desert on 7<sup>th</sup> March, we went to camp at Moascar
    where we completed our divisional organisation for France, by the formation of a Pioneer
    Battalion and each unit trained its own Lewis Gun section with four guns to a Battalion.
    Among our new equipment was the P.H. gas helmet, which was substituted for the old smoke
    helmet and muslin respirator with which we were issued on the Peninsula. The Prince of
    Wales visited Moascar Camp at this time and the 6<sup>th</sup> Brigade was the first
    Australian unit reviewed by him.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The early hours of the 19<sup>th</sup> March found us in open trucks in
    the rain once more en route for Alexandria where next day we embarked on the
    &quot;Minnewaska&quot; for Marseilles. The voyage was pleasant as regards weather but
    nervy as regards submarines and we were glad to tie up safety alongside a French wharf in
    the afternoon of the 24<sup>th</sup> March. The 2<sup>nd</sup> Division was the first
    Australian unit in France except the Siege Artillery and the 1<sup>st</sup> Divisional
    Motor Transport. This being the case our reception was exceptionally enthusiastic. During
    our three days train journey from Marseilles to Aire. We were delighted by the sight of
    the green countryside, the broad sweep of the Rhone and the undoubted warmth of our
    welcome from the people.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We detrained at Aire on the 27<sup>th</sup> March and marched to our
    first billets in Glominghem; more rain. Thus early in out career we had established that
    the 21<sup>st</sup> Battalion moved either in the rain or on a Sunday. At Glomingheim we
    were practiced in route marching on hard roads again, a change from the desert and put
    through a gas cloud. The 6<sup>th</sup> Light Trench Mortar Battery, our friends
    throughout the war came into being at this time. Their little weapon, the Stokes Mortar at
    once took the fancy of us all and ever since when in trouble we have called for the little
    guns, and found them at their posts. During our stay at Glominghem, we were reviewed by
    Lord Kitchener.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On 4<sup>th</sup> April we marched towards the line at Fleurbaix
    staying the first night at Haverskerque (13 miles) and the second at Sailly (10 miles).
    The transport section accompanied the unit for the first time on this march. Previously
    they had been rather out of it, but from out arrival in France onwards they were our
    constant and trusted companions. Come good, come bad, if the rations were obtainable, the
    transport got them up to us and in the getting lost good men and horses too. This march to
    the line can be classed in the second flight of marches, in line, that is to say, with the
    Arneke to Ouest Mont performance (211/2 miles) in October 1916 (our longest one-day spin)
    and the Cappy to Doingt fracas in September 1918.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once again the first Australian Infantry unit to take the plunge, we
    left Sailly for the front line on the evening of the 7<sup>th</sup> April to take over
    from the 10<sup>th</sup> Battalion, Lincoln Regt. But that is starting on the next stage
    of our story.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">En passant it may be of interest to enumerate the various fist
    performances we have to our credit.</p>
    <ol>
      <ol>
        <li>First Australian unit to Garrison Cairo (Aug 1915)</li>
        <li>First Australian unit to be torpedoed (2/9/1915)</li>
        <li>First Australian unit to be reviewed by the Prince of Wales (18/3/1916).</li>
        <li>First Australian Infantry in the line in France (7/4/1916)</li>
        <li>And finally, last Australian Infantry to come out of the line in France (6/10/1918).</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our first days in France were happy days. Glad to be free from the drag
    of the desert; satisfied with the thought that we were now to take part in a campaign in
    which there was a possibility of warfare of movement; fit as fiddles, trained to a hair
    and broken in to the sights and sounds of warfare. We were some Battalion. The idea of
    warfare of movement remained our dream for more than two years before we actually saw it.
    Not till the summer of 1918 did we know the joy of having the Hun on the run. Our dreams
    were then justified and as General Monash has said, we realised that there is no such
    tonic for weary troops as success.</font></p>
