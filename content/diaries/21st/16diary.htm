<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 1st 
1916.</U></B> New Years Day. It rained all day, Had the blues properly so 
stopped in and played cards.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 2nd 1916.</U></B> Church 
parade was held just after a heavy shower of rain. In the afternoon Harold and I 
went for a walk across to one or two of the near by villages. These were quaint 
places built in the valley between two hills. A lot of the houses have only 
three walls, the fourth being the rocky face of the hill. They are like the old 
biblical pictures. At one village, Kontos by name, there was an old cemetery. It 
has it's mass house and bone house dating from 1762. The mass house is very 
quaint and as rustic as can be. The alter is hung with beautiful lace worked by 
the women.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The bone house contains the bones of some 
hundreds or so human beings. They are buried in a grave the same as us and in 
time dug up and their bones (Wrapped in some article of their apparel ) are put 
into this house. On each grave is placed a lantern. On the other side is the 
village garden. There they grow all their vegetables. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>On the other side of town is a row of 
their windmills. These are round stone structures of two storeys. The windmill 
is a series of sticks (6) all strapped together like a wheel and each is 
attached to a sail. This connects with a pinion wheel which turns an immense 
stone on top of another thus crushing the grain. Beside this the village 
drinking well. The water of which is periodically blessed. All this is 
surrounded by very fertile fields.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 3rd 1916.</U></B> We had an 
18 mile route march today. I will try and give you an idea of this little piece 
of earth. The hills are gradually sloped out of flat plains. Out of these hill 
rise others very high, steep, rocky and rugged. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>In places the plains are under sea level. 
The main harbour is called Mudros .</FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>On the other side to us (west 
side) are situated Kastown (Capital), Mudros, and Lemnos villages. These are 
reached by ferry. In the bay are some 50 or so large ships. Today the sister 
ship (Britannic) arrived. There are many very rich fields about the island. 
Ploughing is done by a single furrow if it can be so called. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Sowing is done in the following manner. 
The men do the ploughing. then come the women with their aprons filled with seed 
and scatter it broadcast by hand. Weaving is done by the women folk. They are 
very interesting to watch. The old "Southland" is again in Harbour and is 
leaking badly. At 6.30pm we received orders to pack, destination 
unknown.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 4th 1916.</U></B> We had a 
6 mile march to the boat today, arriving at the pier at noon and were taken out 
by the tug H.M.S. "WATERWITCH" to a big Australian transport, "The ASCANIUS" of 
the same line as the "ULYSSES". The "CALADONIA" and the "HORARATA" are lying on 
either side of us. The "ASCANIUS" it a beautiful boat just the same as the 
"ULYSSES" (One Class) Our mess is in the saloon, some dog eh? About 9pm we 
dragged anchor and nearly smashed into a big battle ship. A little while after 
the "HORARATA" smashed into our stern and broke a couple of lifeboats to 
atoms.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 5th 1916.</U></B> It was 
very rough today. The boat rolled at every angle. Lifebelts had to be 
continually worn in case of another submarine, as we are going across without 
escort. We have taken on a job in the kitchen helping to wash up the silverware. 
For this we get the same food as the Officers. We still know a thing or two 
eh?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 6th 1916.</U></B> At sea 
and very rough.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 7th 1916.</U></B> My 
birthday. I was ill all day. At 10am we arrived at Alexandria. 7.15pm we 
disembarked and boarded the train for TEL_EL_KEBIR. It is raining 
heavily</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 8th 1916.</U></B> At 4am we 
arrived at TEL_EL_KEBIR and it is still raining. All our reinforcements were 
here to meet us. This is the scene of the great battle of 1882. The trenches are 
still in a state of existence about a mile from here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>A canal runs along in front of our camp. 
All our side is barren desert, no habitation whatever. Our mail which has been 
accumulating arrived today. I received 55 letters, 20 odd papers and your three 
parcels. They were just simply great.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 9th 1916.</U></B> We had a 
rest today. Church Parade at 10am</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 10th 1916.</U></B> The 
signallers got orders to pack up again to proceed to the Zietoun school of 
instruction at Heliopolis. It was just like going home again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 11th 1916.</U></B> We were 
today initiated into the rules of the school</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 12th 1916.</U></B> Half 
holiday today. We went into Cairo and had a fly round all day in the 
Taxi.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 13th 1916.</U></B> Received 
a big pay of 7 pounds.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 14th 1916.</U></B> There is 
nothing doing today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 15th 1916.</U></B> We spent 
today in Cairo looking round all the old spots.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 16th 1916.</U></B> Sunday. 
We spent the day in Cairo.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 17th,18th,19th,20th,21st 
1916.</U></B> Nothing to report, only we were completely equipped with new 
clothes. Feel quite a clean boy now.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 22nd 1916.</U></B> This 
afternoon at 4.30pm we started out to climb the big Pyramid of Cheops. After a 
lot of struggling we reached the top at 5.05 pm. I have taken some photos but do 
not know how they will turn out. From here we saw the sunset, it was a glorious 
sight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 23rd 1916.</U></B> I went 
to Cairo today, and during the afternoon met a friend, (An Officer) so dined at 
Shepherd's Hotel at night. Privates are not allowed here at all so did feel 
someone important. This the leading Hotel in Egypt. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 24th. 1916.</U></B> It 
rained heavily today. My word it does seem funny to see rain here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 25th 1916.</U></B> Exams 
started today. In today's subjects were:-</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Morse and Semaphore, signalling with 
flags. I got 98 and 100 respectively.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 26th 1916.</U></B> Half 
holiday today. In the evening we went to the Kursaal, a Music Hall like the 
Tivoli in Melbourne. They have two shows nightly, 6pm to 8.30pm and 9pm to 12pm. 
It is a very pretty hall. In the middle of the roof is a very fine chandelier 
lit up by an electric light. During the performance you are allowed to smoke 
(Ladies included). Dotted along each row of seats are round topped white marble 
tables and waiters are in attendance. During the different acts, one can get a 
drink of anything from a glass of water to the most costly Champagne. I can just 
imagine the cry that would go around Melbourne if such a thing was done in the 
Theatre Royal for instance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 27th 1916.</U></B> 
Continuation of the exams. Subject was the Vibrator on which I scored 97 points. 
In the evening we went into Heliopolis for a stroll.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 28th 1916.</U></B> The 
finish of our exams today. Subjects :- Lamp reading and theory in which I scored 
97 and 86 respectively. In the afternoon, which we had off, owing to the school 
ending, we were paid. Afterwards we strolled into Cairo, had dinner and went to 
the pictures. Here also one is allowed to smoke and get a drink when 
desired.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 29th 1916.</U></B> At 
Reveille this morning, we packed up ready to return to our units at 
TEL-EL-KABIR. We left the school at 10am and at 10.30am caught the train at 
Helmieh, arriving at TEL-EL-KEBIR at 1.30pm where we were greatly astonished to 
find that our Battalion had left for the Canal, so we had to doss with the 
details.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>In the afternoon I went across to see Les 
Hall who was very pleased to see me. Later on I saw Bazil Benaim.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 30th 1916.</U></B> We went 
to church and afterwards strolled across the desert to the scene of the battle 
of TEL-EL-KEBIR in 1884. Here one can still see the old trenches which are, of 
course, nothing so elaborate as present day warfare. I took a couple of snaps of 
them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>January 31st 1916.</U></B> Did a 
lot of clerking work for the C.O. Details. There was a big Military funeral of a 
Capt. of one of the other Brigades. I believe he shot himself whilst cleaning 
his revolver. In the evening we visited the camp picture shows. It was very good 
indeed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 1st 1916.</U></B> It is 
marvellous to see the immense amount of guns and material going in great train 
loads to the Suez. It is one constant stream of long heavy laden trains 
containing mixtures of troops and material. In the evening I walked across to 
the field artillery and saw Stan, Scrivenor and Alex Lilly, They were surprised 
to see me. Whilst speaking to them a big fire broke out in Ordinance. A stack of 
chaff and straw caught alight and made great old blaze.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 2nd 1916.</U></B> At 
Reveille we had orders to pack up once more. At 10am we went on to the parade 
ground and there were fooled about as per usual till 7.30pm when we marched to 
the train. During the afternoon who should I run up against but Douglas Soundy. 
At 11.30pm we arrived at Moasca and from here marched through Ismalia to the 
Canal, a distance of 4 1/2 miles.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The march through was very nice. It was a 
bright moonlight night so we could see what the place was like. The avenues are 
glorious. They are lined with beautiful scented tropical trees which meet and 
intermingle over head. The whole air is scented with them. The march extended 
well into the morning.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 3rd 1916.</U></B> At 
2.30am we arrived at the Canal and had to wait till 4.14am to cross by Pontoon 
Bridge. On arriving on the other side, we still continued for a couple of miles 
to the staging camp and at 5am we finally got a rest and were able to go to 
sleep till well into the morning. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>At 2pm all fell in once more and started 
to march inland. At 6pm we landed for the night. Today's march was 6 1/2 miles 
along an army made road and with packs up all the time. We are now at the end of 
the road. Tea was supplied and my mate and I dug a hole in the ground, wrapped 
ourselves in our blankets and got into it. Here we slept till Reveille next 
morning.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 4th 1916.</U></B> Reveille 
at 6am. After having breakfast we packed up and started out on the most awful 4 
1/2 miles I have ever walked in my life. It was across the desert , the sand 
being all over the tops of our boots. Hot, well I would not say how hot it was. 
Eventually at 1pm we arrived at the camp tired and weary.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 5th 1916.</U></B> We got 
some mail to cheer us up. Here there is not a living soul bar those of the 
Battalion and every direction one looks there is absolutely nothing but sand. It 
is sand to sleep on, walk on and also to eat.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 6th 1916.</U></B> Nothing 
to report today only in this morning's orders my name came out as Lance 
Corporal, some dog eh?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 7th 1916.</U></B> It was 
terribly windy all day. One could hardly bear the sand beating against his skin. 
In front of our camp is an immense sand hill some few hundred feet high. We 
watched this blowing away in tons. By evening the hill was completely a 
different shape.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 8th 1916</U></B>. It 
turned very cold and rained nearly all day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 9th 1916.</U></B> An enemy 
patrol was reported quite close to us. In the afternoon we had sports just to 
keep up our spirits.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 10th 1916.</U></B> An 
enemy aeroplane passed over us this morning. After parade in the afternoon the 
companies were matched against each other for a series of games of football. A 
pretty tiring game in the desert.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 11th 1916.</U></B> We 
heard some shots from one of the battle ships in the canal today. Otherwise 
nothing to report.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 12th 1916.</U></B> The 
rumour is around again we are going to shift. I hope to heavens it is not 
true.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 13th 1916.</U></B> Sunday. 
Church parade in the morning and in the evening we had an impromptu song 
service. Another mail today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 14th 1916.</U></B> A big 
observation balloon was up over us all the day. In the evening my friend and I 
went for a stroll in the desert. We can see the lights of Ismalia from here. The 
desert at night is very weird. Tonight was bright moonlight so we lay down for a 
while. The breeze going across the sand sounded like waves, it took me back to 
the good time we had at Sorrento that Christmas.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 15th 1916.</U></B> It 
rained all day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 16th 1916.</U></B> Half 
holiday. In the afternoon we arranged a sports programme but as usual it rained 
again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 17th 1916.</U></B> A small 
enemy patrol was sighted today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><STRONG><U>February 18th 1916.</U></STRONG></FONT><FONT 
face="Times New Roman" size=2> Another and larger patrol was sighted today so 
causing some alarm.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 19th 1916.</U></B> It was 
blowing terrible today and quite enough to blind a man. At 5am we had to stand 
to arms for 3/4 of an hour. The alarm was only a poor old stray Camel. Another 
mail arrived today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 20th 1916.</U></B> Sunday. 
Church Parade as usual. In the afternoon the General Officer Commanding troops 
inspected our Battalion. Had a very nice song service in the evening.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 21st 1916.</U></B> This 
afternoon Generals Birdwood and Legge inspected our Battalions. It was a 
surprise visit so did not catch it in too fine a state.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 22nd 1916.</U></B> It has 
been very warm all day, otherwise nothing else doing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 23rd 1916.</U></B> This 
morning I had to help run out a new cable. By the time it was finished I was 
terribly tired. The afternoon was the weekly 1/2 day holiday. There was no 
sports as it was to hot.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 24th 1916.</U></B> Nothing 
to report today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 25th 1916.</U></B> It is 
warming up considerably now. I am afraid in a few weeks time we shall never be 
able to exist here. Heliopolis was bad enough but this is cruel.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 26th 1916.</U></B> It was 
very clear today. From the camp on such a day, we can see the canal and Ismalia. 
This morning I just happened to look in this direction as a boat was passing 
through. It looked lovely, just as if it was sailing in the air.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 27th 1916.</U></B> Sunday 
once more. Church parade at 9am. In the afternoon we received some mail which 
was very acceptable.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 28th 1916.</U></B> Nothing 
at all out of the ordinary to report today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>February 29th 1916.</U></B> My 
friend and I applied for leave to Cairo today. Poor me I was in charge of the 
21st battalion Party. Well at 4pm we marched across to the railroad about 2 1/2 
miles from our camp. Here we met the Brigade Officer and proceeded by train to 
the staging camp which is now about a mile from the Canal. We were put into 
tents for the night.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 1st 1916.</U></B> Reveille 
was at 4am. We marched to the canal, cross by ferry, where we landed about 
5.45pm. The fare was 9 piastres single, 3rd class to Cairo. We arrived in Cairo 
at 9.30am. From here we proceeded to have breakfast and then wash and clean up. 
During the day we had a lot of shopping to do. Lunch was at the new Obelisk. At 
6.15pm we got a garry and went down to the station, the train left at 7.15pm. 
All the way to Ismalia I slept soundly. After arriving here safely, we marched 
the four miles once more to the Canal. Here boarded the ferry and had to wait 
for some big boats to pass by.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 2nd 1916.</U></B> After 
waiting for half an hour for these boats to pass we at last got across. By the 
way all the boats going through the Canal carry a very powerful search light at 
their head. One of the boats that went through was a large mail boat from 
Australia.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Well , on arriving at the other side we 
marched to the staging camp and slept for the remainder of the night, and at 
8.30am we started off and marched the 11 miles to our camp. This was terrible as 
there was a terrible storm. At 11am we reached the railhead, where the different 
Battalions parted company and we started off to cover the 2 1/2 miles between us 
and camp. The sand was that bad that we could not see more than a couple of 
hundred yards ahead of us. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>About half way across we came across an 
old gun pit. We sat in here and slept for about half an hour or more. When we 
woke up we were covered with at least, from 2 to 3 " of sand. So you can imagine 
the sort of day. At 1.15 we at last arrived back at camp. I was just absolutely 
dog tired, so we laid down and slept for the rest of the afternoon</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 3rd 1916.</U></B> After all I 
am afraid that Cairo leave is no good. Here I am at 1.30am trying to keep awake 
on my shift, yesterday's wind completely buried the railway, so this morning we 
are sending out two hundred odd men to dig it out. The wind has not yet gone 
down. Sand is blowing everywhere. What were cuttings are now embankments with 
the line buried in places to a depth of 20 feet and what were embankments are 
now valleys with the line hanging across like a suspended bridge.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 4th 1916.</U></B> The 
terrible wind kept up till about noon when at last it settled. All the sand 
hills have completely changed shape, size and position. Where our telephone wire 
used to span a gully, it is now buried under a hill some 200 feet high and where 
it used to cross the hill by posts, it is now suspended in mid air across a deep 
gully.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 5th 1916.</U></B> Sunday once 
more. The rumour today is that we are going to France. In the evening we had the 
usual little sing song service.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 6th 1916.</U></B> Seemed like 
being back at old Gallipoli today. We were out doing our Musketry Course and a 
little further over, the Artillery were also practising. Sounded just like the 
old demonstrations. When we arrived home we found a most scandalous thing had 
happened. Someone was passing the Incinerator where he saw a lot of letters 
burning. On investigation, we found these to be our last week's "out going" and 
part of the "incoming mail". There is to be an inquiry into the matter. The 
latest orders once more are that we move to where I know not.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 7th 1916.</U></B> Reveille 
was at 5.30am. Tents were struck at 6.30am and the Battalion moved off on their 
march to Ismalia ( 10 miles ) at 8.30am. I had to stay and keep up 
communications till the last of the guard left. After all the camels were loaded 
there were a couple left without any load, so we put our packs on them to go 
right into Ismalia. We then started out to walk in.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The first two miles were over the sand to 
the place known as Railhead. Just as I arrived here there was a train bound for 
Ismalia. Needless to say I got in it and rode in arriving there about midday. 
The Battalion arrived about 3pm and we bivouacked for the night. In the 
afternoon we had a swim in the Suez Canal.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 8th 1916.</U></B> The dew 
last night was very heavy. When we woke up this morning our blankets and clothes 
were wringing wet. At 8.30am the whole of the Brigade formed up and moved off on 
the way to Moascar where the Division was massing. We had to go about a mile 
before we got to the canal which was crossed by an army pontoon 
bridge.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>On reaching Ferry Post about a mile this 
side of the Canal we formed up and exchanged our Australian low velocity rifles 
for British high velocity B.S.A. and started off en route for Moascar. We had to 
pass through Ismalia. Here the avenues are something glorious.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The big beautiful tropical trees are 
along each side of the road and meet over head. Along one side is a Canal, on 
the banks of which is the most glorious Conglomeration of scarlet, yellow and 
purple. On the other side are beautiful shady parks with lawns. A little further 
along on this side are the private dwellings ( now nearly all hospitals ) with 
their glorious many coloured flower gardens. The beautiful purple Bouganvillea 
in and out and on top of the trees, along the fences and all over the houses. 
Such a sight I never in all my life saw. In fact it is to glorious to explain. 
You can have no idea. It is like a scene in one of the pantomimes. I could never 
imagine there could be such a glorious and magnificent sight. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Next we came to the native parts of 
Ismalia. Here it is very different. Instead of the fine buildings and flowers 
there are the tumble down dirty smelling places belonging to the 
natives</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>It is altogether a mighty contrast to the 
other parts. We turned off from here now and crossed the Canal by an army 
pontoon bridge and find ourselves in the better class native quarters. Although 
not as good as the first, this is better than the parts we have just left. The 
houses are more regular, tidier and cleaner. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>We continue along this road for about 3/4 
of a mile ( we are now four miles from the Suez ) and find ourselves facing the 
sand once more, but his time it is just literally covered with Tents everywhere 
you look. We continue for about 1/2 mile over this and finally halted at the 
spot for our camp. This place is called MOASCAR-ISMALIA. ( Here we met a lot of 
our old men who had gone away sick and were rejoining the unit )</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>A Canal runs along the bottom of the camp 
but we cannot wash, drink or bath in it because of the presence of a small 
insect which enters into the human skin and gets into the liver and internal 
organs and greatly multiplies thus in time rotting them away.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 9th 1916.</U></B> We were 
once more inoculated. Strikes me, we shall be germ proof shortly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 10th 1916.</U></B> Nothing to 
report today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 11th 1916.</U></B> We had to 
take everything we possess down to be fumigated. Every vestige of clothing was 
done. They were put into a big iron truck, the doors of which were then closed 
and the steam turned on from an old railway engine. Nothing could possibly live 
through it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 12th 1916.</U></B> Sunday, 
Church Parade as usual. Mail arrived today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 13th 1916.</U></B> Reveille 
was at 6am as usual. At 7.30 am we fell in with packs up and started to march to 
Ismalia. It was a great march, some 4 miles there and back. Arriving at camp at 
12.45 pm ,we had the afternoon off.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 14th 1916.</U></B> I met Alf. 
Le Roy today. He looks well too. At 6.30pm we marched out into the desert and 
had a night attack. While it lasted it was very interesting. Arrived back at 
10.30pm</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 15th 1916.</U></B> Nothing 
doing today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 16th 1916.</U></B> This 
morning we marched out into the desert and had an attack by day. This time our 
party acted as the enemy. In the afternoon we all went down to Lake Timsah for a 
swim. It was A1.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 17th 1916.</U></B> At 8.30am 
this morning we went for another roam in the desert. It was a sham attack on a 
hill and the railway. Arrived home at about 12.45pm. After lunch we all went 
down to the lake for a swim.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 18th 1916.</U></B> This 
morning we received orders to pack up once more. The wind was something 
Terrible. It tore our big tent to pieces. Orders were issued that at 5pm we were 
to be reviewed by H.R.H. the Prince of Wales and General Birdwood. After waiting 
about all day, we fell in at 4.50pm for the big parade. At 4.45 it started to 
rain heaven hard. This settled the dust nicely but it cleared up by 
5pm.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The four Battalions formed up the three 
sides of a square and Brigade Head-quarters and Details formed the other half 
side. At 5pm H.R.H. and the General arrived with a body guard of Indian Lancers, 
General Birdwood addressed us and presented us to the Prince. Three cheers were 
given for him. The staff then took post. The whole four bands were massed and 
started off. The Brigade then marched past in a column of four. We have to sleep 
out tonight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 19th 1916.</U></B> 1am 
Reveille. At 1.45am we fell in and moved out to the parade ground. At 2am it 
started to rain heavens hard again, so we had to go back to the tents. 3.15am. 
We marched to the Moascar Station ( about a mile ) arriving there about 4am when 
we entrained in open cattle trucks. 5am we started off.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>All this time it had been pouring so we 
are wet through. 1.15pm we arrived at Quai Abois, Alexandria. Shortly after we 
arrived, who should I see but poor old Billy. He is looking well again. I had a 
good yarn to him until about 4pm when we embarked on board ship once more. It 
was a very nice boat of 14,700 tons and called the "MINNIEWASKA". We have the 
Artillery on board with us. There are troopships laden with troops everywhere. 
Poor unlucky me, fell to Mess orderly the first night. We made our beds on the 
Promenade decks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 20th 1916.</U></B> Reveille 
at 6am and breakfast at 7.30am. So far meals are just the thing. 9.45am we 
started to move and at 10.20am we were clean out of sight of Alexandria. It is 
fairly rough now. So far we have no escort, so feel a bit on the nervous side in 
regard to torpedoes. I am as bad, if not worse, than the rest. Our destination 
is not certain, but we were told we would have four days at least on the water. 
This looks very much like Marseilles. I was very sick all day. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Lights must all be out half an hour 
before sunset.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 21st 1916.</U></B> It is a 
beautiful calm and fine day. 2pm and we were once more inoculated ( a double 
dose this time ). During this there was a very funny incident. The Doctor lost 
his needle just after doing one of our men. As soon as he said he had lost it, 
the chap took of his coat in a terrible hurry to have a look if it was still in 
his arm.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 22nd 1916.</U></B> My arm is 
terribly sore today, cannot move it more than a couple of inches. At sunrise we 
passed two ships and a little while after a troopship. 9am we passed another 
troopship laden with troops. This one left Alexandria 36 hours before us; so you 
can imagine how fast we are travelling. 11am There were at least 16 ships in 
sight. It seemed quiet nice to see someone else. 4.30pm our boat started with a 
lurch forward and started forward at top speed. The ship os just throbbing with 
the engines. Afterwards I found out that we were being chased by another 
submarine. The tail of our boat is practically out of the water with the speed. 
This lasted until well into the night. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>7pm. We can see the lights of the 
Valetta, the Capital of Malta.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 23rd. 1916.</U></B> 6.30am we 
passed some very large islands. We had boat drill today. This bought back some 
very sorry memories to a lot of us. 8.30am We passed some more very large 
islands. Marseilles is to be our destination and at which place we expect to 
arrive at 7am tomorrow.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>About 11am we passed a large hospital 
ship. It made a very pretty picture. During the afternoon we got news from the 
wireless room that the sister ship to this one ( "MINNIOPOLIS" ) was torpedoed 
about half an hour ahead of us. There were no troops on board. It seems that it 
was meant for us, as we had all the details and Head Quarters on board. Just 
after sunset it came up very rough.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 24th 1916.</U></B> We had a 
very cold and rough night last night and in the morning's orders we were ready 
to pack up for disembarkation to day. I braved going below for breakfast, but I 
did not altogether enjoy it. 12.30pm We sighted some land. This turned out to be 
the coast of France, thus our first glimpse through the thick fog. Land 
continued to be the view.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>We are now getting close into Marseilles. 
I was unable, owing to a thick haze, to take any photos so will try to give you 
a pen picture of our entry into this Port. At 2pm a fairy large island appeared 
on our right. As we approached this it loomed up like a beautiful Cathedral with 
the main land for a background. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>A little further on is another, it was 
barely visible on account of the haze. As we approached this one it presents the 
appearance of the enormous pipes of an organ. Shortly after passing this ( 
though a valley between two </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>cliffs ) we catch sight of a couple of 
houses with red tiled roofs and as we proceed the view between these hills turns 
to a large hill covered with buildings and surmounted by a lovely 
Church.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Just here on our opposite side has 
appeared a tiny island on which is perched a big light house. Will now return to 
the other side of the boat where we see a small steamer being escorted by two 
French Torpedo boat Destroyers. To return to the scenery, we have now turned 
round the corner of this last island. Here a fine sight is laid before 
us.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The City of Marseilles lays stretched on 
both sides as far as we can see. On our left is an island on which huge forts 
and guns are mounted. In front of this is another small island completely 
covered with a fort. Next come long strings of beautiful white houses with red 
tiled roofs. Then stretch hills and valleys in front of other higher 
mountains.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>As far as the eye can see to the right 
and left these valleys are all spanned by huge viaducts. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>In some cases the standards of these are 
an enormous height. Now come pile after pile of houses ( white and green ) up 
the hill sides and in the centre of which are two signs to greet poor soldiers 
from the desert, one a blue one with "DEWARS WHISKY" and the other "REGINA 
HOTEL" 250 beds and 100 hot baths.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>From on front of here to a distance of 
about two thirds along the picture to the right extends a stone wall from out of 
the sea. This eventually turns out to be a break water. Behind this from left to 
right you see some very pretty and large white buildings, some right on the 
waters edge and some perched up in the hills. Then one sees a dense mass or 
groups of shipping to about two thirds along the wall.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>From here to about three quarters the way 
across the picture extends a glorious grey building some thing like the 
Flinder's St Railway Building in architecture but very much larger and more 
beautiful. Surmounting this and perched on the top of a hill is a most beautiful 
Church ( white ) of world wide fame. The tower of this is adorned on top with a 
life size guilt statue of the Virgin and her child. This gives such a majestic 
appearance to the whole place.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Then comes the large coal-humper like one 
span of a suspension bridge. From here to the right and when we look behind the 
stern of our boat are the hills and valleys in front of larger mountains which 
are nearly covered with trees. In every little nook and crevice are crammed 
large and small buildings.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>While we have been looking at this our 
boat has slowed down. On looking over the side you can see the Pilot just 
boarding. We start off again and steam straight for the left end of the wall. It 
is now about 3.30pm We slow down again and turn up between the sea wall and 
coast.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The first thing to greet our eyes is a 
camp set out on a fine green grassy paddock. We can also see the electric trams. 
On the right is the sea wall, and on the left are big stone quays</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>After passing 5 or 6 of these, we at last 
stop. We are being greeted on all sides by the inhabitants.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>We turn up between this Quay on which, 
standing on guard, are a couple of Australians, about 6 French soldiers, two 
Hindus, another whom I have not before seen. At the end of here the hill has 
been cut away and built back by a brick wall some two hundred feet high. On top 
of this are perched some quaint houses. To the left of these and in the valley 
are seven large chimney stacks. At a glimpse these remind one of Northcote. We 
have now passed in our light belts. It seems nice to be able to walk about in 
comfort.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>As it is getting dark I will close for 
today. I think we will disembark early tomorrow morning.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 25th 1916.</U></B> Reveille 
was at 6am , but army like we were up at 5am , at 7.30am we left the boat. Our 
men had to help unload some motors. while we were doing this the remainder of 
the Battalion were getting into the train, but when we came to entrain they 
found there was no room for us, so we were left behind. After they had gone we 
went done to another station. On our way we passed some large docks. One thing 
we noticed was the women old and young were doing all the work. I don't think we 
saw one eligible man out of uniform. At noon we went for a walk up the 
town.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The first street we got into was very 
narrow and dirty and with two tram lines, leaving practically no room for 
traffic. From here the streets got even narrower. The class of people here are 
similar to the Port Melbourne inhabitants, all the working and labouring 
classes. This very narrow street opened out into a big square lined on all sides 
with trees and in the centre of which is a large arch with beautiful statues. 
This is in honour of the Republic. The street gets as narrow again; But here the 
buildings and class of people are much better.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>All the women get about without hats. 
They wear shawls. All through the City are large numbers of large Restraints. 
The streets here open out into a large place with three roads, a line of trees 
dividing the roads. The shops are very classy in these quarters. The streets get 
narrow once more. In the distance we can see a very tall column which is another 
of the many monuments of the Republic. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The streets on either side seem to cut up 
the hill at an angle of nearly 40 degrees. All the buildings have a sort of 
balcony around each window. This gives the building a very unusual appearance. 
The streets are all flags and their are soldiers everywhere. In these parts is 
the City's Fashion Parade. Mourning is well to the front here. We now turn up a 
side street which runs up a hill at an angle of 35 degrees to the celebrated 
Church Marseilles "THE BASILIQUE DE NOTRE DAME DE LA GARDE". This is some 
thousand feet above sea level.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>After climbing this street you have to 
climb some few steps. This Church is usually reached by a large electric lift. 
Arriving back at the station at 3pm and at 3.30pm entrained. There were eight to 
a second class compartment. Almost as soon as we started we passed through a 
series of tunnels and over viaducts. One tunnel took over 20 minutes to go 
through. The scenery is something beautiful. Our course was mostly along the 
sea, over the viaducts which were seen when we first landed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 26th 1916.</U></B> We are 
still going strong. When we woke up we could not see more than few yards out of 
the train for the heavy fog. When the fog lifted we found we were following the 
course of the river Rhone. The scenery is lovely with all the quaint villages 
and orchids. 10.5 am we stopped at Lyons. By what we could see from the train it 
is a very pretty city built on the banks of the Rhone with fine houses all over 
the hills, dipping right down to the waters edge.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>It is getting much colder now as we are 
going north. As we pass though the different villages the people are giving us a 
great reception and throw flowers to us.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 27th 1916.</U></B> When we 
woke up in the morning we found that we had stopped for an hour. During this 
time seven expresses passed en route for Paris at the rate of over 60 miles an 
hour and all in a space of 40 minutes. They did go some too. Most of today we 
followed up the river Seine; the scenery is still very fine. In place of the 
orchards it is now vineyards. The bush scenery is poplars and birch.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>All these trees are just covered with 
mistletoe and the trunks of the trees are covered with ivy. One cannot give any 
idea of the scenery. We passed many Chateaus and villages. The whole country is 
much closer populated. The wild flowers are lovely; they are yellow primroses 
and red and white daisies. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>3,30pm We passed within 12 miles of Paris 
and saw the electric trains. These do not have the usual overhead wires but a 
third rail that conveys the current. We could also see the great Eiffel Tower. 
After passing here we followed for some distance the course of the river Oise. 
Here nearly all the bridges have been blown up but are now being 
repaired.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 28th 1916.</U></B> 6am. We 
got out of the trains and marched to where we were billeted for the morning. 
10am We started off once more on the eight mile march, passing Aire at 2pm, 
2.45pm we arrived at Clominghem but found they had no billets for us so we have 
to march back a mile to the next village ( Rincq ) here we were billeted for the 
night in a barn. It was very cold.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 29th 1916.</U></B> 7.30am We 
marched back to Glominghem where we got a further billet. All the houses here 
have the cross above the door and there are some very fine crucifixes along the 
road side. Every village has it's own Church. The yard of which is full of 
graves. There are some very fine Churches too.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 30th 1916.</U></B> It is very 
cold and plenty of water. In fact it is water everywhere. It snowed today but 
not much settled. We are only 26 miles from the firing line, and can hear the 
booming of the guns all the time. At night we can see the flashes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>March 31st 1916.</U></B> I was very 
crook. Lord Kitchner reviewed the Battalion today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 1st 1916.</U></B> Nothing 
doing today. I am still feeling crook.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 2nd 1916.</U></B> The 
Battalion had a mimic Gas attack to get them used to using Helmets.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 3rd. 1916.</U></B> Nothing 
doing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 4th 1916.</U></B> We got 
orders to pack up once more this morning. 1pm we started on a march of 11 1/2 
miles and passed some lovely villages en route. 5.30pm we arrived very tired at 
Haversque where we were billeted for the night.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 5th 1916.</U></B> 8am We had 
a very cold night last night. The barn I was in was pested with rats. We have 
started off on the remainder of our march. 11am we stopped near Merville for 
dinner. 3.30pm we landed at Saille-sur-la-lys. Everywhere there were signs of 
bombardment of the town. One big Church has been gutted by fire. In the distance 
we can see a ruined Church tower doing a great balancing feat.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 6th 1916.</U></B> I am still 
pretty crook again. It is terribly cold. All last night we could hear a heavy 
artillery duel. In fact it is going on all day more or less. We are very near 
the trenches now.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 7th 1916.</U></B> 5am. we got 
orders to pack up once more and at 6.30am we moved off with two days rations 
marching about 5 miles to the trenches. En route we could see signs of 
bombardment every where, what with broken windows, holes in the roof and walls, 
some places are in a fine state. Where we are the snipers are very busy; so have 
to lie low. On our left is a big village, Bois Grener. In this place there is 
hardly a whole house and all that is left of the beautiful Church is one wall of 
the tower. That is absolutely riddled. The remainder is reduced to one mass of 
ruins.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 8th 1916.</U></B> I went 
through the front line today. Owing to the great amount of water in the ground, 
the trenches are about 3 feet deep and then built up with breastworks. What 
little is dug is full of water. Duckboards are placed all along the trenches. In 
places there are about 6 inches of water. All the houses are in ruin.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>We are in a ruined house which is not to 
bad but we have to keep out of the way of bullets. There has been fairly 
constant artillery fire all day. We are in "Y" farm near Smiths Villa and past 
Barrier and Elbow Farms and Tinned and Dead Dog Saps. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 9th 1916.</U></B> There were 
many aeroplanes up today. During the afternoon the enemy shot another piece off 
that poor tower in Bois Grener. Between 10 and Midnight, there was a violent 
bombardment.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 10th 1916.</U></B> We were 
constantly shelled all day today. I saw some houses blown up and burnt. 6pm we 
could hear the bombardment on our left again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 11th 1916.</U></B> It was 
terribly cold today and has been raining all day. They are still bombarding on 
our left.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 12th 1916.</U></B> It is 
still raining and cold today. The big guns are going some on our back 
areas.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 13th 1916.</U></B> 2pm we 
were relieved from the trenches and at 5.15 we started off arriving at 
Fleur-Baix at about 6pm. Here we shall be billeted as to the line for 4 days. It 
is bitterly cold today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 14th 1916.</U></B> It is 
terribly cold and bleak today. About 2pm a large fall of snow. Later I went 
round town for a walk and did not find one wholly intact house. I think every 
pane of glass is shattered and some of the houses well, it is a marvel how they 
stand.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The big Churches are one mass of holes, 
while the magnificent and costly windows are shattered beyond repair. In the 
graveyard the tombstones are shattered beyond recognition. The havoc wrought by 
the shells is awful. It is here that one of the famous British Regiments were 
wiped out. As they turned the corner of the street ( Main Road ) , they were 
caught by enemy machine guns.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The place, although in ruins is still to 
be seen. One thing I noticed in France along the roadside at short intervals are 
shrines and crucifixes. In 9 cases out of ten these are practically not 
destroyed although houses in the vicinity are blown sky high.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>About 6pm there was another artillery 
duel very near on our right.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 15th 1916.</U></B> All last 
night the roar of the guns was terrific. There is still a big duel on. It was a 
bitterly cold night too. One of the billets in our village was shelled and burnt 
today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 16th 1916.</U></B> There was 
another slight fall of snow today. In the afternoon they shelled another farm 
and destroyed it by fire. It did make a blaze.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 17th 1916.</U></B> Once more 
it is cold and raining. I do not think this place is capable of anything 
better.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 18th 1916.</U></B> We all 
marched to a place called Erquinghem near Armentiers, ( a distance of about 3 
miles ) Here they have an immense disused Dye works, the vats of which are 
filled with hot water in which we were able to have a hot bath. Clean clothes 
were given to us for our dirty ones. My word I can tell you we thought we were 
in clover. In the afternoon we got leave into Sailley ( about 4 miles from here 
). After having a good wander around and having tea we went to a concert given 
by the British Division. It was in the form of pictures and a Pierrot Troupe. 
The artists were Officers and are all professionals. I can tell you we enjoyed 
it too.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>We walked home, during which time it 
rained heavily. We were wet through.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 19th 1916.</U></B> At 7pm we 
packed up and went out to the trenches, it rained all day. At 10pm we were 
pulled out of bed to go and get a lot of Officers kits. My word, didn't we go 
crook.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 20th 1916</U></B> It is very 
cold and has rained all day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 21st 1916.</U></B> Some very 
large shells came out our way today, but no damage done.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 22nd 1916.</U></B> Still 
raining and a heavy fog. Things are exceptionally quiet. A little different to 
last Easter. Eh?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 23rd 1916.</U></B> Raining 
again. Poor old Fritz started shelling today. He set fire to two more billets. 
The aeroplanes were very active. We were greatly amused by one of ours who would 
persist in flying at about 200 or 300 feet off the ground. This annoyed Fritz 
considerably because he was too low to shell, yet too high to hit with the 
rifles so they had to let him look at what he wanted. In the evenings our guns 
opened on the enemy and set fire to a couple of his billets.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 24th 1916.</U></B> Things 
were exceedingly brisk today. Shelling was heavy on both sides. In the evening I 
had to go with a party to draw rations. Just as I was going along the road a 
snipper picked us up by the light of one of his flares and had a shot at me. The 
bullets whizzed right in front of me and wounded the man with whom I was 
walking. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Shortly after there was very brisk rifle 
fire and the message came through that our patrol had been shot, one being 
killed. About an hour after this we turned our machine guns on to one of Fritz's 
and shot the lot of his patrol; this time I think, seriously.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 25th 1916.</U></B> It is a 
most glorious day. Real spring weather. There is a fair bit of artillery fire on 
both sides. Fritz put another shot into the remains of the Church Tower and 
knocked down another column, now leaving one pillar standing. A little later he 
put incendiary shells into a farm. It was a pretty sight to see the flames burst 
everywhere. Aircraft has been very active all day. 10pm We were relieved from 
the trenches and arrived back at the billets in FLEUR-BAIX at 11 pm.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 26th 1916.</U></B> Today was 
even better than yesterday. Again the enemy planes are exceedingly active. The 
condition of things makes one feel like going home at times. All the fruit trees 
are in full bloom and the flowers are out everywhere. The place is becoming one 
mass of colour, and the air is full of the song of birds. Some more mail arrived 
today. Notice was also given that leave will be granted to Anzac men at the rate 
of six men every four days for eight days leave in England. I am just dying for 
my turn to come round as London is the place I have always wished to see. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>At about 8.30pm there was a most terrific 
bombardment on our right and left, in front and behind us. The roar was awful. 
At 10.30pm they were still going strong. We were all watching them and could 
hear for miles around the gas alarms. At once we all set to and got dressed and 
put on our gas helmets. The attack, however, was not very strong. At 11.30pm all 
was normal again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 27th 1916.</U></B> It is a 
bonza Day. Last night the gas attack did no damage. About 11am there was a big 
bomb accident. An officer was explaining it when it exploded, killing himself 
and a private and wounding ten others.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 28th 1916.</U></B> I was on 
duty at 4 to 6 this morning. At 3.30am it was light here so I went for a walk 
round the house where our headquarters are. The garden is lovely. I have pressed 
some of the flowers to send to you. In the afternoon we went for a walk. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 29th 1916.</U></B> We once 
more went to Armentiers for a bath. I managed to get a look at the out skirts of 
the town which is very beautiful, but every available hole was blocked up with 
sand bags. While we were there Fritz put some very large shells in destroying 
about four houses.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>April 30th 1916</U></B>. 2.30am. 
The gas alarm was sent through the phone. We had to sleep with our helmets by 
our side. The alarm was given to the people on our left by two German deserters. 
A large mail arrived at 8.30pm. We have packed up and are waiting to go out to 
Divisional Supports. At 10.30pm we started out on a night march to Jesus Farm ( 
About 1 mile the other side of Erquinghem ). On the road there the Officer in 
charge took us along the wrong road, making the march four miles longer than it 
should have been. We arrived at 1am.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 1st 1916.</U></B> We are 
feeling stiff after last night. The billeting officer did not have room for our 
section so had to sleep where we could.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 2nd 1916.</U></B> I have a 
terribly bad ear today. Think it is an abscess and I am nearly driven mad with 
it. At 3pm the Germans sent over some enormous Howitzer Shell and set fire to a 
large farm nearby. Whilst the fire was at it's fiercest, another shell landed 
right in the middle and burning timber went everywhere.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 3rd 1916</U></B>. My ear is 
still very bad, and have had to have it fomented all day. Since 12 o'clock today 
some big Howitzer shells have come over. They seem to be after one of our guns. 
One shell landed in the middle of the road and made a hole 12 ft deep so you can 
imagine the damage they do. 10.30pm. These big shells are still coming over, 
making 80 or more today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 4th 1916.</U></B> 3.30pm. An 
aeroplane caught fire in mid air and dashed to earth all ablaze.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 5th 1916.</U></B> Things were 
quiet today until about 6pm when a few shells begun to fly over. About 7pm some 
coloured flares went up and immediately an artillery dual took place. Everywhere 
was lit up with a flash of the guns and the bursting of shells. The row was 
terrific. This continued until about 10pm when we had to 'stand to' until 
11pm.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 6th 1916.</U></B> The result of 
last night was, at about 9.45pm the Germans stormed our trenches with gas etc. 
Inflicting heavy casualties on our men and succeeded in penetrating into our 
lines. However, they were unable to hold it. About 5,000 of our shells and 7,000 
of the Germans were used during the scrap. Some more of their heavy shells came 
near us today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 7th 1916.</U></B> Church Parade 
as usual. It rained nearly all day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 8th 1916.</U></B> 7.30am. Once 
more went to baths. The remainder of the day it rained heavily and was very 
cold.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 9th 1916.</U></B> It is still 
raining and as cold as charity.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 10th 1916</U></B>. There was 
some activity both in the air and with the artillery today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 11th 1916.</U></B> Very quiet 
today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 12th 1916.</U></B> Quiet 
again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 13th 1916.</U></B> Went to the 
baths for a wash. Still raining heavily.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 14th 1916.</U></B> Church 
Parade as usual at 9.30am. I was just thinking in what funny places we have had 
Church of late. Today it was in the farm yard with the fowls, horses and cows 
all around us. In the afternoon we had to go out on parade as usual. I can tell 
you we did not half like it so all got into the barn out of the way and read all 
the afternoon. At 5.30pm I went for a walk to Nieppe. </FONT></P>
<P align=left><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>It was about three miles from 
here and is a very pretty little place although like all the other towns up this 
way has suffered considerably through shell fire. It is a suburb of Armentieres 
to which it is connected by electric tram, now not working.</FONT><FONT 
face="Times New Roman"> </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 15th 1916.</U></B> It was very 
cold and wet today. In the afternoon I walked into Armentiers, about 2 1/2 or 3 
miles from here. My word there are some really beautiful buildings and Churches 
here, also some very fine bridges over the river Lys.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The gratings in the footpath and all such 
like holes are blocked up with sand bags. On our way back we stopped and had a 
good look at Erquinghem. Both here and Armentiers the signs of bombardment are 
well to the fore.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 16th 1916.</U></B> It was a 
glorious day today. There was considerable aerial activity. Saw Basil Benaim 
today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 17th 1916.</U></B> Went to the 
baths again this morning.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 18th 1916.</U></B> Nothing 
doing today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 19th 1916.</U></B> I went to 
Nieppe this morning. Just as I arrived I saw an armoured train in action. It was 
a great sight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 20th 1916.</U></B> During 
parade today we saw an aeroplane catch fire in mid air and dash to the earth 
ablaze. All day they have been heavily shelling Erquinghem.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 21st 1916.</U></B> Church 
Parade as usual at 9.30am. During which there was considerable aerial activity. 
3.30pm. they started shelling Erquinghem again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>8.30pm there is a big fire raging on our 
right and lighting all the surrounding country.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 22nd 1916.</U></B> They kept up 
the shelling of Erquinghem all day. At 7.30pm they started on our Brigade 
Headquarters and blew them up. This was the work of spies. They are like rabbits 
here., In every nook and cranny.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>We have some rare sport at times in 
chasing them and their methods are unique. Some use the hands of clock towers, 
others by different movements and attire in the fields in view of the enemy, of 
by lights and movements of window blinds at night. Another method was to give 
code letters to aeroplanes by placing the washing ( which is always put on the 
ground in these parts, no lines being used 0 to form letters or morse code 
signs.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Belgium, the frontier of which is only

Today's work was through a spy in English Staff Officer's Uniform.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 23rd 1916.</U></B> They are 
still dropping a few shells over our way.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 24th 1916.</U></B> It is very 
cold today. There was considerable aerial activity. At one time we saw five big 
battle planes overheard.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 25th 1916</U></B>. Rained all 
day. Nothing else to report.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 26th 1916.</U></B> Went for a 
bath in the afternoon. The remainder of the day it rained.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 27th 1916.</U></B> Had a little 
sports meeting this afternoon to keep our spirits up. 4pm we went for a stroll 
along the river bank. While so doing so one of our chaps dived in and cut his 
leg very severely on a snag so I had to act in the capacity of stretcher 
bearer.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May28th 1916.</U></B> Nothing 
doing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 29th 1916.</U></B> Packed up 
once more and shifted to a place called Chappelle d'Armentiers. We arrived to 
find our billet was a bonza house which we had all to ourselves.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 30th 1916.</U></B> We had a 
look at the Church today. My word it was simply beautiful. The statues are 
astounding, but like all the others it had shell holes in it. We are about a 1/4 
of a mile from the main street of Armentiers.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>May 31st 1916.</U></B> There was 
considerable aerial activity today. They put some very large shells about 500 
yards from us in the afternoon. Five times today I had to go out mending lines 
which had been broken.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 1st 1916.</U></B> Today was of 
unusual interest. 11.15am half the Battalion marched to Croix-du-Bac to be 
reviewed by Mr. Andrew Fisher and Mr. Billy Hughes who arrived at 4.15pm. During 
the time we were waiting for him there was considerable aerial activity 
resulting in an aerial duel right above us. It was a great sight. Shrapnel was 
falling all around us so we had to take cover. On our road home we passed 
through Armentiers in a part which was in utter ruin. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>It was terrible to see after seeing all 
the other good parts with it's fine houses and streets. About 7.15pm one of our 
observation balloons broke away and the men had to come down in parachutes. One 
fellow landed in the German lines. Immediately the men were clear our guns 
started shelling it but it drifted off into Belgium , the frontier of which is 
only about 1/2 mile from here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 2nd 1916.</U></B> Nothing 
doing today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 3rd 1916.</U></B> Very 
quiet.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 4th 1916.</U></B> Harold went 
on leave today so I am acting in his place. Some simply tremendous shells are 
landing quiet close to us today. 6pm We started a very violent cannoning to 
which the Germans replied forcibly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 5th 1916.</U></B> About 
midnight last night there was some very considerable activity. It rained all 
day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 6th 1916.</U></B> It is 
terribly cold and raining. I was told today that I would be going on English 
leave on the 6th. Not bad news eh? At 11pm tonight we started a terrific 
bombardment of the German trenches on which The Australians made a raid. It was 
very successful. They kicked up a terrible row.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 7th 1916.</U></B> Bad news 
today, all leave is stopped until further orders.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 8th 1916.</U></B> Nothing 
doing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 9th 1916.</U></B> Nothing much 
doing. It has been raining like mad all day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 10th 1916.</U></B> I went for 
a walk this morning to one of the neighbouring villages, or at least, the ruins 
of it. It was terrible. Not a single place was complete and the railway is bent 
in all shapes.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 11th 1916.</U></B> We are 
moving to the trenches tonight. At 7.15pm we moved off. En route we pass through 
the town or the remains of Chapelle d'Armentieres.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>This has been a pretty place in it's 
time. Now it is an absolute ruin. The Church is about levelled to the ground bar 
one small wall of the tower. We eventually arrived at the trench Head Quarters 
which were in the remains of a farm. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Out of about 20 rooms of the house there 
is only one intact. Here we sleep on a real spring mattress but one has to stay 
on guard all night with a broken aeroplane propeller to keep off the rats. 
Another great game with the rats was to fix your bayonet on your rifle and on 
the end of which was placed a piece of cheese which had been previously heated. 
This was held at the entrance of the rat hole until he came out, that bought him 
in the line of fire. Then we pulled the trigger and blew the rat to ------ the 
next chapter.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 12th 1916.</U></B> Rained 
heavily all day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 13th 1916.</U></B> Still 
raining and very cold. Went for a tour round the trenches today. There is a 
village the other side of the German trenches. One part of our line goes through 
a Cherry Orchid in which there is an abundance of good ripe Cherries. From here 
we can get a good view from behind Fritz's line. The village is an absolute 
ruin, also the Church. We can also see one of the Forts of Lille. Running 
through part of our lines are some of Fritz's old trenches which we took from 
him some time ago. They are solid concrete.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Just outside the remains of the farm ( 
FERME DE BIEZ ) in which are our Head Quarters, are the remains of what has been 
a beautiful rose garden and a few fruit trees laden with fruit.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 14th 1916.</U></B> I found two 
dear little kittens in among some old rubbish today so bought them in and made a 
pet of same. It is still raining heavens hard.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 15th 1916.</U></B> There was 
considerable aerial activity today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 16th 1916</U></B>. All quiet 
up till noon when both sides started to put some enormous stuff over. 6pm Both 
the guns and trench mortars started up a terrible din for about half an hour. 
9pm. I had to go out and man a lamp station. This is known as Suicide Station as 
it was so dangerous. 11pm. Every available gun opened fire on the German 
trenches. It was veritable hell. We had a great view of it all from our station. 
11.45 pm. The Germans are now replying with some very heavy stuff. 12 midnight. 
Still going strong.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 17th 1916.</U></B> 12.30 am. 
the bombardment has stopped. It turn out that the New Zealanders on our right 
made a raid on the German trenches. 1 am We were just having a bit of something 
to eat when the gas alarm was given. 1.30 am. The "All Clear " was given and we 
went to bed. 2.14 am. Another gas alarm. 3 am. "All Clear" given once more. This 
is getting over the fence, what sat you?</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The remainder of the day there was heavy 
shelling by Fritz and also a fair bit of aerial activity. When we came here this 
was considered a very quite sector but we have made it a very hot shop now. In 
fact the remaining inhabitants are beginning to think so too and are starting to 
pack up and clear out.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 18th 1916.</U></B> There was 
some terrible activity against the artillery. At 11pm our artillery opened up on 
our immediate front so as to cover a raiding party. This was a great sight but 
caused a terrible row and havoc. 11.45pm Fritz answered back very heavily. The 
raid was not too successful.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 19th 1916.</U></B> The 
shelling by Fritz was terrible today, and caused some considerable damage. I saw 
Alex Lilley and Stan Scrivenor today. The day light saving scheme came in force 
today. All clocks have to be put on an hour. 11.15pm. We gave Fritz a bit more 
of our artillery just for luck.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 20th 1916.</U></B> 4 am. The 
enemy are shelling our trenches terribly. I had to get up and repair our lines 
which had been broken. 9.15 am. They started to deliberately shell one of the 
most beautiful Churches in Armentiers. At 11 am. The Spire broke out into flame. 
Just then ten shells landed on the burning place and blew it sky high. It is 
something awful to think they cannot leave an innocent Church alone.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The spire looked like a big blast 
furnace. I viewed the surrounding country from the look out which is at the top 
of the only remaining chimney of the Ferme de Biez. We could look right down on 
all of Fritz's territory and see the outer Forts of Lille. Another interesting 
thing is, we are using the old Armentiers-Lille telegraph cable for our phones. 
This saves a terrible lot of work. For eight months after the Hun occupied 
Lille, Armentiers had, through the medium of this cable, a full supply of 
electric light and telephone communication with Lille from the big power station 
there. It was one of our nightly jobs to creep out each night with a telephone 
into No- man's Land and attach it on to the end of the cable which had been cut 
just outside Fritz's trench and see if we could intercept any of his 
messages.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>There was a fair aerial duel today 
resulting in one of our planes landing in German territory and the loss of one 
enemy plane. It was a thrilling sight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 21st 1916.</U></B> All this 
morning we well peppered all of Fritz's positions in front of us. In the 
afternoon he returned it for us and blew our trenches to pieces. It was 
something awful. Some 15 inch shells landed about 400 yards from us.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 22nd 1916.</U></B> We once 
again gave him a heavy bombardment and once more he blew up our trenches . It is 
very nerve racking. Shells flying in all conceivable directions. In the evening 
we put some very large shells and mortars over to him and he returned shell for 
shell, it was a perfect hell all day long. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>In the afternoon I took our party to our 
billets as we were being relieved but we had to return. Just before midnight the 
enemy turned the gas on us. This is the third alarm we have had now.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 23rd 1916.</U></B> All today 
the enemy has been shelling us heavily. At about 10pm we were relieved for our 
short spell.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 24th 1916.</U></B> The 
Sergeant and myself were detailed to attend the school of instruction today. At 
12.15pm we started to walk. On reaching Erquinghem we met a motor transport 
which took us down to Criox-du-bac. Here we were met by two motors from the 
Flying Corps. They took us to the aerodrome near Merville. We travelled off at 
about the rate of 40 miles an hour, one could hardly sit on the seat. In the 
afternoon and evening we spent in looking over La Gorgue and Estaires. These are 
really pretty places.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 25th 1916.</U></B> At 9am we 
had our first parade and then a look over all the aeroplanes. In the afternoon 
the whole squadron left on a bombing raid. It was an impressive sight. Just as 
the last plane left one of the bombs fell out and burst. It set fire to 
everything within the vicinity.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>After this we went into Merville. Here we 
spent a grand afternoon. At 9.30pm the men started a concert. I can tell you it 
was some class too. They had a proper orchestra and scenery. I really enjoyed 
it. All night there was a violent bombardment. It was at Neuve Chappelle, we are 
only a few miles from it. Our instruction needed a lot of moving about today, so 
a car was placed at out disposal. We went to Merville, Haversque, Estaires and 
several other places. It is more like a joy ride than work.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 27th 1916.</U></B> It rained 
heavily all this morning and right up till 4pm when the Major in charge gave 
orders that we were to have a fly. My word it was just simply marvellous. My 
pilot was a real sport. He did a tail slide, a spiral, a nose dive and a couple 
of other performances. We passed over Merville, Haveraque, Estaires, La Gorgue, 
Nieppe, Stienwerk, Armentiers and the outskirts of Lolle ( From which we could 
see the entire city ). Here we could see the trenches which we had been holding 
and those all around Ploegstert to Messines, and also a part of the Ypres 
salient.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Ypres it self could hardly be 
distinguished. While we were up the old Hun tried one or two shots at us but 
these went very wide. Once owing to rain, we had to go up above the clouds. This 
was a weird experience. Could I have used a Machine gun we would have gone 
further, altogether we were up over 40 minutes. This was the second longest for 
the afternoon. Oh! You cannot imagine what the place looked like. In the evening 
we had a great time with a bonza gramophone. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 28th 1916.</U></B> We have to 
go home today. At midday, we left in the car for Croix-de-Bac. Here we caught a 
motor transport right into the heart of Armentiers. 11pm we had to go to 
Armentiers for a piano.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 29th 1916.</U></B> From 
midnight until this morning, there has been a big bombardment. At 8.15pm we 
started a violent bombardment which is the preparation for our Brigade raid. It 
is the biggest yet attempted. The bombardment of the enemies lines continued 
until midnight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>June 30th 1916.</U></B> Last nights 
raid was most successful. There has been a slight artillery duel all this 
afternoon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 1st 1916.</U></B> It was quiet 
all today. At 10am the enemy most violently bombarded our positions at 
Armentiers and set about 6 fires going in the town.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 2nd 1916.</U></B> 9 am Fritz 
started bombarding the beautiful Armentiers Cathedral which is about a 1/4 of a 
mile from here. His first shot blew part of the spire off. After about two hours 
shooting he gave it up leaving the Cathedral in a terrible state. He broke the 
backs of the roofs of each wing of the Cathedral and so scarred the main 
entrance that one would not know it from a scrap heap.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 3rd 1916.</U></B> An aeroplane 
shell which did not explode in the air, fell in front of our headquarters at 6 
am wounding two of our men and cutting all our wires. Orders to move were once 
more issued. 10.30 am we started on a 8 mile march to La Creche. The mud was 
something awful.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th 
1916.</U></B> All these days were quiet and spent at La Creche.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 8th 1916.</U></B> On the move 
once more. Today we proceeded to Merris, a distance of 9 miles in the south 
westerly direction. Here we spent the night.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 9th 1916.</U></B> At 8 am we 
started off again to Ebblinghem, a distance of 8 miles and still in a westerly 
direction. Here we were billeted in a beautiful Chateau, the grounds of which 
were simply lovely.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 10th 1916.</U></B> We started 
off once more to Canpagne, 5 1/2 miles west. Here we once more put up in a 
Chateau. ( in the stable this time ).</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 11th 1916.</U></B> At 7 am we 
started again. This time to St. Omer via Arques which is a big place. St Omet is 
a tremendous place about 5 miles away. The glorious Cathedrals make one so that 
he will never forget them. There is one very fine old Cathedral ( Which is in 
ruin ) of most majestic appearance. Here we entrained in cattle 
trucks.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>After an hour and a half ride we landed 
at Calais, a very pretty place. The smell of the sea was lovely once again. From 
here we went to Bolougne, also a very fine place on the sea coast. Next we 
arrived at Etaples. This the base and great training centre and as cold as 
charity. All this time the scenery has been very pretty.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>We now turn inland via Abbyville, for 
Amiens arriving there at about 7 pm. This is a very fine city indeed with the 
most beautiful Cathedral. From here we marched through the main streets of the 
town to St. Sauvier, a distance of 9 miles or more arriving there at about 11.30 
pm. We were dog tired.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 12th 1916. </U></B>No 
Entry.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 13th 1916.</U></B> In this 
town is a pretty old Church founded over 570 years ago but re-built about 200 
years ago.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 14th 1916.</U></B> I was 
acting chief Chef today. Do not know if the boys will survive. In the afternoon 
we had a sham attack on a wood. Most of the woods in France are artificially 
planted and make the most beautiful scenery.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 15th 1916.</U></B> We had 
another attack today. This one was on a Valley. My word, words cannot explain 
the scenery here. The fields are red and blue with poppies and corn flowers, 
making a very pretty sight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 16th 1916.</U></B> Once more 
we made a move, a distance of 6 miles to Villers - Bocage and passed some more 
very pretty places.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 17th 1916.</U></B> Today we 
had a look over the old Church. It dates from 1200 AD but was re-built about 
1540 AD. Some age ,Eh ?. It rained the whole of the day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 18th 1916.</U></B> Today we 
moved on to Puchevillers, a distance of 7 miles. This is a terrible slow 
hole.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 19th 1916.</U></B> We had a 
rest today. Tomorrow we are off once more.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 20th 1916.</U></B> Today our 
march was 7 miles to Varrennes. Here we can see the firing line quite plainly. 
It is very cold.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 21st 1916.</U></B> We are 
awaiting orders for an immediate move.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 22nd 1916.</U></B> We watched 
the bombardment up forward tonight. It was such as I have never in all my life 
thought possible.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 23rd 1916.</U></B> The 
bombardment kept up all night and got even more intense at 3 am. I believe we 
have obtained another success through this little lot. Sunday today. Church 
Parade as usual. This may be the last we have before we get into the thick of 
it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 24th 1916.</U></B> The 
bombardment is still going on incessantly.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 25th 1916.</U></B> The 
bombardment is still as severe. One could never imagine or explain 
it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 26th 1916.</U></B> Reveille at 
3 am. We marched to Albert, a distance of 6 miles, arriving about 8 am. This 
lovely town is practically in ruins. There is not one straight chimney stack in 
place. The glorious Cathedral is in absolute ruins. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The tower, was, at one time surmounted by 
an enormous statue of the Virgin Mary and her Child. Through some freak hit by a 
shell, </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>It is marvellous how it remains the way 
it is. At 8 pm we marched up to the front line supports ( Some few miles ) One 
would not credit the damage our side must have inflicted on the enemy. We are 
now some miles behind the enemy's old front line. During the night we had 
several gas alarms. The number of guns are absolutely beyond explanation. It is 
a perfect little hell let loose, for us with our own guns , so you can imagine 
what it must be like for the enemy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 27th 1916.</U></B> This 
morning we had a bit of a look round. La Boisselle or what remains of it, a few 
broken bricks and what remains of the neighbouring hills, a crater, two or three 
hundred feet by 2,500 feet in diameter. Every square inch is dug up by shells. 
This mine was a signal for a great advance.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 28th 1916.</U></B> We are the 
Battalion in supports. 11 pm After a fairly solid bombardment all day by both 
sides, our Brigade ( in fact the whole Division ) made a charge for the great 
Pozieres Ridge. You never in all your life imagine the bombardment. It was a 
perfect hell on earth.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 29th 1916.</U></B> As far as 
our Brigade was concerned the charge last night was a success, but the next 
Brigade made a horrible mess of it. The casualties are terrific. Our wounded 
have all been coming down all day in the hundreds. In the evening I was up at 
the Red Cross Dressing Station making coffee for the wounded. This an all night 
job so good-bye another night's sleep.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 30th 1916.</U></B> After being 
up all night, at 5 am we went back and tried to get a little sleep but our luck 
was out. We had to pack up to go into the trenches. The trip up there I shall 
never forget.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>There is, on the road up, the remains of 
Contalmaison and woods, now a few scattered bricks and splintered logs and 
stumps. There is not one spot where one can find one square foot of earth not 
dug up by shells. Next we come to the remains of Pozieres. Here it is something 
awful. There is not the slightest trace of a house or woods left. In most places 
even the bricks and tree stumps are missing, having been pounded to 
dust.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The ground is just honeycombed with shell 
holes and the whole aspect and contour of the ground is changed. All the old 
German dug-outs which have been some fine places, are now all practically 
destroyed and are full of corpses in all stages of decomposition. Some of these 
are 40 feet below the ground.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The saps, or the remains of same and the 
ground is just covered with corpses, some terribly mangled and all in an 
advanced state of decomposition, the stench is something awful.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>These are bodies of the Huns, Tommies and 
Australians killed in the last advance. This is the most awful sight I have ever 
seen. The shells that pass from side to side are enormous and many. One cannot 
bear the row at times. During the afternoon I was hit on the back of the head 
with a log of wood, but luckily, my steel helmet saved me, so now have a fine 
old lump and a headache.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>I never in all my life thought things 
could be in such a state of desolation and ruin. Even from pictures you cannot 
imagine the time we are having.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>My word it has made a different man of 
me. There are hundreds of dead and decaying dead lying everywhere. There are 
arms legs, pieces of bodies, armless, legless, and headless. They are the most 
gruesome sights I have ever seen in all my life.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Even after they are dead they could not 
rest in peace as the shells would land on top of them and blow them to pieces. 
The casualties are very heavy and we cannot keep pace with the wounded who are 
lying everywhere and who are being wounded over and over again and being killed 
in dozens. I think I had better shut up or you will be getting the 
blues.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>July 31st 1916.</U></B> The 
bombardment by both sides today was terrific. One big 6 inch shell burst about 
10 feet from me and knocked me flat.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 1st 1916.</U></B> Our head 
quarters and trenches were bombarded without ceasing today. It was terrible. The 
number of shells in the air at one time is simply outstanding. We are out all 
day mending the telephone wires which are broken as fast as we lay or mend 
them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 2nd 1916.</U></B> Our 
headquarters was once more the centre of the Huns fury. He shelled us all day 
very heavily. I never thought it possible for such a bombardment. It was with 
4.5, 6 , and 9.2 shells.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The dugout which was solid concrete just 
simply danced and trembled all day. We could not keep a light for the 
concussion. This was kept up till midnight. During the bombardment all our wires 
were broken. We tried to keep them mended but were ordered to abandon the 
attempt. I tried to get communication by lamp. All the boys said "Goodbye" when 
they heard what we had to do. Anyhow the enemy must have seen us and put a 5.9 
over at us. It blew me and my lamp sky high and hurled the chap who was helping 
me right down the steps of the dugout.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 3rd 1916.</U></B> They are 
still bombarding as heavy as ever. The casualties are fearful. This continued 
till 2.30 am. At 12.30 I had to go with a dispatch. The shelling was so heavy on 
the track we usually took that we had to take to another and longer track. This 
took us two hours to do which is usually a 15 minutes trip. The particular 
little bit of the road I am referring to is where the main sap leading up to the 
front line and is called the Centreway Sap, crosses the sight of the Bapaume - 
Albert Road where it used to enter Pozieres, then a little hundred or so yards 
between here and our Headquarters. On this spot there are more dead than any 
other spot around.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>It is literally covered with at least 
three hundred or more dead. In the dark one is walking on dead everywhere. In 
fact he sleeps with them. The bottoms of the saps are absolutely covered with 
them and the tracks are quite soft where they have been trodden into the 
earth.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>To come back to our message, we 
eventually arrived there safe and then made a run across country for it. As we 
were nearing our destination we were knocked over three times in succession by 
shells exploding about 3 or 4 feet from us. You have no idea of the marvellous 
escapes one has. They started bombarding us again at 3.30 pm with the same 
violence as last night. He spots a man going along a trench ( which we do at 
record speed ) and starts sniping us with 5.9 shells.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>He is enabled to do this as he is in full 
view of us, he on the hills and we lower down. The best event of the day was at 
6pm when we were relieved by one of the other Battalions. We were so weakened by 
casualties and the strain of the past few days that the Doctor ordered that he 
would not be responsible for the unit. Coming out we had to race for dear life 
with the shells.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 4th 1916.</U></B> Things 
have been very busy all day preparing for tonight's big charge. All day long 
there was a constant bombardment of his lines and back areas to which he replied 
with extra ordinary vigour. At 8.30pm every available gun was opened on him and 
at 9.45 our boys went over the top. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>All night the bombardment continued with 
great violence.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 5th 1916.</U></B> The charge 
last night was most successful. We have taken the last two lines of trenches and 
are now on top of a hill, or ridge, I should say. Our Casualties are very heavy 
and the prisoners numbered about 1000. We do not know what to do with them. Many 
were killed by their own shells whilst being bought out. One batch turned on 
their escort, seized their rifles and shot them, so we sent the whole batch to 
Kingdom come.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The road down is just covered with dead 
from today's scrap. Dozens of stretcher bearers are lying dead with their once 
wounded burdens along this road ( know as the Chalkpit Road ). Although our 
Battalion did not actually go over in the charge ( they were carrying the food 
and munitions up ) we suffered very severe casualties. Up to 10 am three counter 
attacks have been launched at our new positions but were all beaten off 
successfully.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>At 4 .30pm the whole Battalion moved up 
into supports. Part of the Division is being relieved by a new Division. 7 pm I 
was detailed to go right back to Brigade Headquarters. This in now a little 
better than before.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 6th 1916.</U></B> The stream 
of wounded from last night's and the previous night is still going through. The 
enemy is also surrendering in one and twos from out of isolated shell holes. At 
4.40pm we were completely relieved and proceeded to a place called Tara Hill 
near the Becourt Wood, not far from Albert. During the night the enemy shelled 
us and caused a few casualties.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 7th 1916.</U></B> At 8 am we 
packed up and started to march ( a sorely depleted and war torn Battalion ) vie 
Millencourt to just out side Warloy-Baillon, a distance of about 5 or six miles. 
Here we camped for the night in a field.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 8th 1916.</U></B> At 10 am 
moved into Warloy where we were billeted.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 9th 1916.</U></B> We had the 
day to ourselves for a rest,. This is a fairly large place and there are some 
very pretty French girls here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 10th 1916.</U></B> 11 am we 
had once more to pack up and march, the road, a distance of three miles, where 
we were reviewed by the King and Prince of Wales, their Staff and General 
Birdwood. After this we continued our march 10 miles further on to just the 
other side of Talmas where we were camped in an apple orchard, Bois-Monsier near 
La Vicogne for the night.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 11th 1916.</U></B> 9 am once 
more on the track. Today we did eight miles to Berteaucourt where we are to 
rest. The scenery is very pretty, it is all hills and vales.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 12th 1916.</U></B> Today we 
had to drill as in peace camp. Where we drill we have a fine view of the 
surrounding country which is most beautiful.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 13th 1916.</U></B> Sunday. 
The usual Church Parade was held. In the afternoon we went for a walk round the 
town, which is quite a large and pretty place. It is nestled down in a valley 
between three big hills which rise in terraces just outside town.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 14th 1916.</U></B> Drill as 
usual. In the afternoon we were caught in a terrible thunderstorm and drenched 
to the skin.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 15th 1916.</U></B> Went for 
an unofficial visit to Leger-les-Domart and St. Quen.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 16th 1916.</U></B> Drill as 
usual.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 17th 1916.</U></B> Drill as 
usual.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 18th 1916.</U></B> We 
marched out to the old apple orchard Talmas and camped for the night.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 19th 1916.</U></B> All last 
night it rained heavens hard, but had to sleep out in it; consequently at 8.30 
am we had to start out in the rain and drenched to the skin through mud and 
slush to march 6 miles to Rubempre.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 20th 1916.</U></B> This 
morning we marched 5 miles to Vadencourt, where we camped in the open for the 
night. In the afternoon there was a Brigade Church Parade, after which our 
General ( Birdie ) inspected us and distributed some medals to the 
Brigade.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 21st 1916.</U></B> Today we 
marched 7 miles to Albert where we camped in the open for the night and once 
more it started to rain, so were wet through, the second time this 
week.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 22nd 1916.</U></B> It was 
terribly foggy this morning. The Battalion moved up to support trenches at 4.45 
am. Here we stayed all day and at 6 pm we moved up to the front line.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>On the way up the guide lost us so we 
were wandering all over the place for about two hours.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 23rd 1916.</U></B> The 
shelling was very heavy all day. During the morning I had to take a suspected 
chap down to Brigade Headquarters. Coming back a big shell burst on the side of 
the trench and completely buried two other chaps and myself. We were buried for 
some time, I felt very funny when I saw daylight again. There was one funny 
thing I must relate to you.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>In the Centreway Sap, is, protruding from 
the side, the hand of a corpse and which has turned black. It is held out like 
someone begging. I do not know whose it is as there is only the hand showing, 
but someone, with a sense of humour has placed a piece of paper in it on which 
is written "Gibbit Backsheese". It has evidently reminded him of the beggars in 
Egypt. Anyhow to whoever it belongs is useful even after he is dead, as we use 
it to tie the telephone wires too.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 24th 1916.</U></B> It was 
fairly hot tonight and the shelling was pretty lively. In the afternoon, we 
changed our positions on the extreme right ( in front or near the old Pozieres 
windmill ) to the left ( in front of Mouquet Farm ). During this process our 
Battalion suffered very severely.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 25th 1916.</U></B> Today has 
been awful, the shelling is terrific. At 10 am both Reg and I were buried by a 
shell, and a little later I was knocked done by another. I can tell you it shook 
me up a bit. 6.30 pm We started to shift our head quarters up to the front line. 
Half way up, the enemy started up a great shelling match so we had to turn 
back.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>This was the famous Kay Sap. The floor of 
which is as soft as butter with the dead that have been buried. The whole 
surrounding country is littered with corpses that have been thrown out of the 
trench when it was the front line. The amount of abandoned material here is 
terrible. Just as we turned round to go back, a piece of shell hit me on the 
helmet and made a dint in it 3" long and about half wide. It stunned me for the 
time being. Eventually, we arrived at our destination. At 4 am tomorrow morning 
our Battalion is to go over in this position. The shelling here is 
cruel.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 26th 1916.</U></B> After 
sitting awake all last night our Battalion went over at 4.45 am. The shelling on 
both sides is terrific. 5 am The wounded are starting to come back. They say we 
are nearly to our objective. 6 am The men are still holding on, casualties are 
very heavy. Reg and I tried to get a message across the open country just taken, 
to the new front line.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The wounded and dead are lying 
everywhere. We could not find our Officer ( afterwards I found out he had been 
captured along with his platoon. ) During this trip I was sniped in the arm with 
a machine gun bullet. Owing to loss of blood I could not go any further, so had 
to get into a shell hole while Reg went on, on his own. Just as he left me a 
shell burst in the hole in which I was sheltering and I got a piece of this in 
the back. At the same time as this another shell landed into the hole in which 
Reg was. I thought he was a gone coon.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>To my surprise when I was coming in with 
the stretcher bearers who should pop out of a shell hole but Reg. I was pleased 
to see him too. Whilst I was in this shell hole I was buried for about 15 
minutes by a shell which burst on the side and blew it in. Any how I soon 
managed to get out again and returned to the old place.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Here we sat along with about 200 or 300 
wounded in the quarry just waiting to be wounded again and again as many were 
and to watch our mates getting blown to bits. The shells are just pouring into 
this place. We have hardly any Officers left and precious few men. The stream of 
wounded is constant.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>9 am The shelling has eased off slightly. 
There are very few of our Battalion left now. They have been caught in some sort 
of trap. This is something awful. Taking advantage of this lull in the shelling 
all those who could walk or even crawl made for the dressing station about half 
to 3/4 of a mile away.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>All the way back along the Kay Sap are 
the fresh dead. These are those who tried to get back during the heavy shelling 
but were killed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Just before we left, we could see the Hun 
massing for a big Counter attack so we turned the stokers mortars on him and 
inflicted terrible severe casualties. One could see the Hun sailing through the 
air every time a mortar exploded.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>When about half way down the Sap on our 
way to the dressing station a shell burst in front of us. It blew the head of 
the man in front of me right over my shoulder, but the two leading ones were 
never seen again. Of this lot I received a piece in the left shin. So now I am 
lame and cannot walk.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>From this Station we were passed on to 
another about a mile further on ( Casualty Corner , as it was known ) where they 
gave us hot coffee and sent us on by ambulance to Becourt Wood Dressing Station. 
Here our wounds were properly dressed and we were sent per motor ambulance to 
Vadencourt Hospital. This is where we marched through on our way up. Little did 
I think I would return to here in this state. Here our wounds were examined once 
more and we were inoculated against lock-jaw. We were then sent to the casualty 
Clearing Hospital at Contay to await clearance to the Base. We spent the night 
there.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 27th 1916.</U></B> Sunday 
today. I did not have much sleep last night as I was very crook. 7 pm We were 
all put on a hospital train on which we travelled all night. I was pretty crook 
all the way down about half way I went out to it, through weakness and loss of 
blood, I suppose. During the time I was thus some one took all my souvenirs, I 
was so wild too.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 28th 1916.</U></B> 2 pm 
Arrived at Rouen. By what I could see of it was a very fine place. here we were 
taken in hospital ambulance to No 1 Australian General Hospital' when the Doctor 
saw me, he marked me as "Cot case" England. Billy came in to see me today. Just 
shortly after he left I took another bad turn.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 29th 1916.</U></B> We had a 
terrible thunderstorm today. Billy came to see me again today. The Sisters are 
very good to us here. They are all Australian.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 30th 1916.</U></B> 10 am We 
were put into a French Hospital Train which I can tell you is not a patch on 
ours, and sent to Le Havre. Here we were put into an emergency Hospital until 
the Hospital Ship arrived. This we boarded at 9 pm. It is a bonza boat called 
the "Panama" Once more I took a bad turn and knew practically no more for the 
rest of the voyage.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>August 31st 1916.</U></B> After a 
good passage over we arrived at South Hampton and were put on a Cardiff bound 
Hospital Train. The scenery was just glorious and the people gave us a great 
welcome on landing.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>The excitement was too much for me so did 
the overbalancing trick again. From the station we were sent on to No3 Western 
General Hospital where they operated on me almost immediately.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 1st 1916.</U></B> We had 
a very nice concert here today. All the beds were wheeled into the big hall 
where the whole of the company from the Revue at the Cardiff Empire Theatre gave 
their turns as at night. I can tell you it was fine too.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 2nd 1916.</U></B> This 
afternoon a few of us were allowed to be packed very carefully in blankets and 
pillows galore in a motor and go for a trip to Penarth. This is a very pretty 
place. They gave us a very fine tea but poor me, I was not allowed to eat 
anything as I am on poet wine and Champagne and a very few light things. 
</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>My the way the Doctor told me that my 
lung had been damaged and that there was a piece still in my chest and which was 
impossible to move. So I shall have to abide by his orders. What say you ? I was 
not sorry to get back to bed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 3rd 1916.</U></B> One of 
my mates braved a walk around Cardiff today. I was packed in a chair and he 
pushed. We sneaked out of the Hospital and had a good look around. I never 
thought I could get so weak in so short a time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 4th 1916.</U></B> Much 
stronger. Allowed to eat all soft things now, A special tram car was waiting for 
us to take us to Victoria Park where the ladies gave us a grand concert and tea. 
It was very enjoyable.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 5th 1916.</U></B> We once 
more went up to Victoria Park today and had a good time. Coming home we took the 
wrong tram and landed down into the city proper of Cardiff. It is a lovely 
sight. Right in the middle of the city is an old castle some 500 to 600 years 
old. It is a glorious piece of work. I am going to try and walk 
tomorrow.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 6th 1916.</U></B> Today 
we walked to Victoria Park, it took a long time but never the less we got there. 
We are just beginning to enjoy this life now we can get around. I am getting on 
fine now, although I cannot yet use my arm, or walk without a limp. These will 
all right themselves again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 7th 1916.</U></B> Feeling 
much better today. Went to some sports at Victoria Park and had a good 
time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 8th 1916.</U></B> My back 
was very bad today so had to stay in bed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 9th 1916.</U></B> At 
Ninian Park the ladies gave us a sports meeting and tea. It was a great turn 
out.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 10th 1916.</U></B> My 
friend and I went to Roath Park today where we had a great time. In the evening 
the choir from the Church came round and conducted the service. The singing was 
a real treat.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 11th 1916.</U></B> We 
went for a stroll round Cardiff. We had a good look at the exterior of the 
castle. The architecture and statues are very fine. The government buildings 
next door are a very fine example of modern architecture. In the evening we had 
a fine concert at the Hospital.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 12th 1916.</U></B> We 
were today transferred to Harefield Hospital. Things are very different to 
Cardiff.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 13th 1916.</U></B> My 
mate and I went for a walk round the village today. It is a pretty place 
although very slow.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 14th 1916.</U></B> My 
mate was transferred to Salisbury Plains so am now on my own.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 15th 1916.</U></B> It was 
very cold and wet today so could not go out at all.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 16th, 17th, 18th and 19th 
1916.</U></B> Nothing to report these days other than that I was not to 
good.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 20th 1916</U></B>. This 
afternoon four of us went to Admiral Dawson's for tea. His home is in this 
village. We had a very fine time.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 21st 1916.</U></B> It is 
bitterly cold. My arm is still bad, cannot make out what is the matter with 
it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 22nd 1916.</U></B> I got 
some letters from Australia today. No doubt they do put new life into 
one.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 23rd 1916.</U></B> Went 
for a motor drive to Mrs. Thornton of Beaconsfield ( Middlesex ) where we were 
entertained at tea. In the afternoon there was croquet, tennis, bowls etc. I had 
my first game of tennis ( one armed of course ) and got on fine.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 24th 1916.</U></B> 
Sunday. was not feeling too good today so stayed at home. There was a Zeppelin 
raid tonight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 25th 1916.</U></B> We had 
a most beautiful concert tonight. It was given by Mrs. Munday and party ( all 
Australians ) and was really high class. Another Zeppelin raid tonight. These 
are quite exciting. Two of last night's Zeppelins were bought down.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 26th, 27th, 28th and 29th 
1916.</U></B> All these days are spent with the Dentist. Quiet a nice time too, 
swollen face, no sleep, etc. Had a most enjoyable concert tonight by Australian 
artists.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>September 30th 1916.</U></B> It was 
very cold and rained all day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 1st 1916.</U></B> It was a 
quiet day today. At 7.30 pm we had the warning to extinguish all lights and 
about 11.30 pm they arrived, I saw one Zeppelin pass right overhead. Later it 
dashed to earth in flames. It was a marvellous sight. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 2nd 1916.</U></B> Cold and 
raining all day. Had a good concert in the evening.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 3rd 1916.</U></B> Rained 
all day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 4th 1916.</U></B> This 
afternoon, I was one of a party entertained by Miss Aikman of Melbourne, we went 
by car to Northwood then train and underground tube to the Apollo Theatre. Here 
we saw the play " Hobson's Choice ". It was lovely. After we were entertained at 
tea at the Victoria Club.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>It was just lovely but it is nothing but 
lift to the tube here, ramp and lift there, in fact lift, tube, tube, lift etc, 
everywhere.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 5th 1916.</U></B> Rained 
all day again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 6th 1916.</U></B> Still 
raining. There is an Australian mail in today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th 
and 12th 1916.</U></B> There has not been anything doing all these days. Have 
not been too good so stayed home.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 13th 1916.</U></B> It is 
now to be clearly seen that Autumn is here. The leaves are turning all the 
beautiful shades of crimson and yellow, while some trees are now 
leafless.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 14th 1916.</U></B> Very 
Cold and wet.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 15th 1916.</U></B> Very 
cold and wet.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 16th 1916.</U></B> A big 
batch of wounded left here today for Australia. The ones who were left gave them 
a great send off. How I wish I was one of them.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 17th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 
21st 1916.</U></B> It has rained incessantly so have been unable to go 
anywhere.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 22nd 1916.</U></B> I spent 
the afternoon at Admiral Dawson's and quite enjoyed myself.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 23rd 1916.</U></B> Today I 
was marked for convalescent camp. Do not know where I shall be sent.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 24th 1916.</U></B> My mate 
was sent to Weymouth today. We were very disappointed as we had made all our 
arrangements to go on leave together.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 25th 1916.</U></B> We had a 
very good concert tonight by a celebrated French Singer, supported by her 
English artists. It was very nice indeed.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 26th and 27th 1916.</U></B> 
Cold and raining again.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 28th 1916.</U></B> A 
concert party by the name of "Chocolates " gave us a very fine concert this 
evening.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 29th and 30th 1916.</U></B> 
Again it is raining. If this keeps up I am afraid they will have to issue us 
with lifebelts to enable us to float.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>October 31st 1916.</U></B> 7.15 am 
Had to draw my kit and at 10.15 am left by train for Weymouth, arrived there 
about 6.30 pm. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>November 1st 1916.</U></B> Today we 
were graded and grafted into our respective grades. I am B.1.A.C.2. Last night 
we had a terrible thunderstorm, put me in mind of Gallipoli. This camp is 
something awful, mud every where. It is quite near the beach. About 200 or 300 
yards from the beach lies a big sandbank, 3 feet above high tide and about 8 
miles long. This is the work of a tidal wave which came some years ago and 
lasted a quarter of an hour. We have to sleep on hard boards. It is an awful 
come down after hospital.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>November 2nd 1916..</U></B> A good 
start, on fatigue today.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>November 3rd 1916.</U></B> Very 
wet, at 10.30 am we left for "4 Depot" at Wareham, 17 miles away. Just before 
leaving I had a bit of a look round the town of Weymouth. It is very pretty and 
put me in mind of St. Kilda.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>November 4th to 24th and a part 
25th 1916.</U></B> This part was evidently removed by the Censor, for some 
reason or another. It contained about a very large air raid and other 
interesting things, including my visit to Poole and Corfe Castle.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>Continuation of November 25th 
1916.</U></B> In the morning I went to the bank and drew the money you sent me. 
After this I went for a walk round and had a look at the Mansion House, the Bank 
of England and Royal Exchange. In the afternoon an Officer friend of mine booked 
two orchestra stalls at His Majesty's Theatre, where Oscar Asche and Lily 
Brayton are playing "Chu Chin Chow", after the style of "Kismet ", but far much 
more gorgeous. At 7.30 pm we dined at the Savoy, the most fashionable in London 
and patronised by Royalty.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>November 26th 1916.</U></B> Went to 
Harefield Hospital this afternoon, but found the Sister I liked the best had 
gone to Hospital. I went to a Picture show in the evening.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>November 27th 1916.</U></B> I came 
into the Union Jack Club to live today. This is a really lovely Club and quite 
as good as any of the big hotels. The entrance hall is in blue tiles, with the 
dining hall on the left in green tiles and the writing, reading and smoking 
rooms on the right in red. After booking my bed, I went for a real tour round to 
Westminster Abbey and Cathedral and Houses of Parliament. The architecture of 
these is something beautiful. I also saw the law Courts, Somerset House, War 
Office, Trafalgar Square and Monument, Piccadilly Circus and St. Martin's "in 
the field" Church.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>In the evening I booked seats at Drury 
Lane Theatre for "The Best of Luck" the scenery of which is something beautiful. 
This is the oldest Theatre in London and it is of enormous size.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>November 28th 1916.</U></B> While 
strolling down Victoria Street, who should I see, but Den. He is on furlough 
from France. We went for a walk round Piccadilly Circus. While we were down here 
at 11.30 am an enemy plane dropped several bombs on London. The reports were 
terrific. In the afternoon we went all over St. Pauls. This isn't what one could 
term beautiful in every sense of the word but very old and quaint. </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Dates in the Crypts go back as far as 800 
A.D. We booked seats at the London Pavilion in Piccadilly Circus for the 
evening. The revue "Pick-A -Dilly" was being played.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>November 29th 1916.</U></B> Just as 
I got off the Piccadilly Tube this morning I met an Australian Girl who used to 
come out to visit our boys at Harefield. We took a walk over to Buckingham 
Palace to see the changing of the Guard.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>It is a great sight and the Palace is 
rather pretty. The Queen Victoria Memorial, which stands bin front is a 
marvellous piece of work. Next we walked to Hyde Park and along the Rotten Row 
to the Marble Arch, also a beautiful piece of work made entirely of marble. We 
booked two stalls, second from the front, at the "Lyceum" Theatre for the play 
"Monte Cristo". After Alexander Dumas' work. It was something 
beautiful.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>November 30th 1916.</U></B> This 
morning I went along and saw the Guard change over at the Horse Guards. It was a 
great sight, even better than that at the Palace. Then I walked on along past 
the War Office, and the officers of the Admiralty, all of which are very pretty 
places. In the afternoon I took ill, so had to go to bed for the remainder of 
the day.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 1st 1916.</U></B> In bed 
all the morning. During the afternoon I walked down the embankment to the London 
Bridge, West minster and Blackfriars Bridges. These are fine structures. On the 
embankment is a very old Obelisk, known as "Cleopatra's Needle ". This was in 
1500 B.C. erected in the City of "On " which is the sight of the present 
Heloipolis ( Egypt ). In 12 B.C. it was removed to Alexandria and lay there 
until some years ago. It was eventually brought to England on the steel cylinder 
but abandoned in the Bay of Biscay where it was left to drift for some time 
until rescued and erected here.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>We again booked seats at the Vaudeville 
Theatre for the Revue "Some". It was lovely and we quite enjoyed it.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 2nd 1916.</U></B> I took a 
Taxi to the Tower Bridge this morning. It is a marvellous structure. Afterwards 
I went over the famous Tower of London. It is also really marvellous and beyond 
words. I sent a descriptive book home last mail.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>In the afternoon, I went with my friend 
the Officer for a motor boat trip up the Thames. It was A.1. Had a lovely time. 
We booked a box at the Alhambra Theatre for the " Bing Bong Boys are here". We 
had a box right up against the stage and had a bonza box of sweets on the 
rail.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>When the Comedian, George Robey, came out 
we were answering him back so he spotted the box and calmly walked over, took 
our box of chocolates and offered it all round the artists on the stage. This 
bought the house down. We took it all in good part so he walked over to the 
opposite box and did likewise, to an old dame over there. Oh ! and she did go 
off too. Next scene he bought in two new boxes of chocolates and gave us the 
large one which would cost about 5/- and gave the old girl the one costing about 
9 pence. This settled things completely. My word we did enjoy this evening. We 
afterwards had supper at the Savoy.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 3rd 1916.</U></B> This 
morning we took a car for the day and went into the country. The scenery was 
glorious, I quite enjoyed it. We passed some lovely old ruins on our 
way.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 4th 1916.</U></B> We went 
for another walk down the embankment this morning. The seagulls down here are 
quite tame and will feed out of ones hand. I went to Wandsworth this afternoon 
to see Nurse Morrison ( George's cousin ) but they told me she had left, so I 
was disappointed. I spent the evening and had dinner at the Savoy.</FONT></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 5th 1916.</U></B> Took the 
electric train to Southgate today to see Georgie's people out there, but I am 
doomed to disappointment, they were out. At 11.15 pm I caught the express to 
Scotland. This is the fastest train in England. It does 400 miles in 8 hours, 
counting all stops. At one place she does 90 miles per hour, so she travels 
some.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 6th 1916.</U></B> Arrived 
at Waverley Station, Edinburgh at 7.15 am. I crowded a lot into today. After 
having a wash I went all over Edinburgh Castle, which is a grand old place 
standing on a rock 230 feet above street level. Then I went over the Scott's 
Memorial and Calton hill on which are some very fine pieces of ancient 
architecture.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>After dinner I took a car out to the 
Forth Bridge. This is a truly marvellous piece of engineering work. In the 
evening I went to the theatre ( wasn't much ) and caught the 10.15 pm train to 
London.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 7th 1916.</U></B> We 
arrived at 6.30 am. After having a bit of a sleep I started on another big day 
by going over the Westminster Abbey. This is a glorious sight and beyond all 
words. The original building dates back 1,000 years. The tombs and statues are 
lovely. round the outside are flocks of pigeons. They are as tame as can be. 
There are similar to these at St. Pauls. From here I went up the Great Shopping 
Centre, Oxford circus, Oxford Street, Fleet Street and Regent 
Streets.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>It is wonderful here. All the Melbourne 
drapers would be swallowed up in a couple of these shops, which seem to have no 
ending. I went from here down to the Strand and home.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>After Dinner I went over Madam Toussards 
Waxworks. They are very good indeed. Here I shall try and give you a slight idea 
of London.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>Well the traffic is wonderful. There are 
hundreds and hundreds of taxis. The motor buses run about 25 yards or less 
between each other and the trams even less. One can go to any part by Tube. 
These are all underground and built in four layers and reached by lifts or 
escalators ( moving stairways ) Then there are underground electric trains and 
steam trains level and overhead, so you can imagine the size and quantity of the 
traffic.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2>At night everything is almost totally 
dark because of the air raids. Restaurants are shown by tiny red lights and 
theatres by blue. Hundreds of motors, taxis and buses with their two dimmed 
headlights turn the roads into fairyland. The sky is all streaked with search 
lights. Altogether it is a wonderful sight.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 8th 1916.</U></B> I caught 
the 10 am train to Wareham and thus finished my furlough. We arrived here about 
2 pm.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 9th 1916.</U></B> I was 
shifted to a new hut today and am now in with a terrible lot of 
chaps.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 10th 1916.</U></B> It is 
very cold. At 10 am during the Church Parade we had a terrible hail storm. In 
the afternoon this cleared up and turned to a frost. The ground is getting as 
hard as iron.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>December 11th 1916.</U></B> An 
Australian mail is going out today so must close this epistle of a Diary and 
post same.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=2><B><U>From December 12th 1916 to December 
31st 1916.</U></B> Diary for this period was lost in the mud in the trenches and 
could not be found.</FONT></P>
