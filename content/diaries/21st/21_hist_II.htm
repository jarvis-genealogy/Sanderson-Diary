      <P align=justify>Embarkation took place at Alexandria on 30<SUP>th</SUP> 
      August, the ship pulling out of the harbour the same day. On board the 
      "Southland" with us were 2<SUP>nd</SUP> Division Headquarters, 
      6<SUP>th</SUP> Inf. Bde. H.Q., "B" Coy. 23<SUP>rd</SUP> Battn and various 
      details.</P>
      <P align=justify>The voyage was uneventful until the ship had nearly 
      reached her destination, Mudros Bay, when we had our first test of 
      discipline in the face of enemy action. At this time the regulations for 
      the wearing of lifebelts, submarine guards and the like had not been 
      instituted, so we were very much taken by surprise when the transport was 
      torpedoed off the Island of Stratae, at 9.50 am on the 2<SUP>nd</SUP> 
      September 1915. The troops on board were just assembling for 10 o’clock 
      parade, and many including the writer saw the torpedo coming. It struck 
      just forward of the bridge and the ship listed rapidly. There was some 
      confusion among the crew, but the troops quietly put on their life belts 
      and stood by at their boat stations.</P>
      <P align=justify>By 11 am all the boats, mostly collapsibles were launched 
      and the few troops left on board were taken off by the hospital ship 
      "Neuralia" which together with several other vessels arrived on the scene 
      a little before noon. A volunteer party of eighteen remained on board and 
      under the directions of the ship’s officers got up steam before a salvage 
      crew was put on board from a destroyer. The "Southland" then, under her 
      own power was beached in Mudrus Harbour about 7 pm. All the small boats 
      were picked up by 3.30 pm and the Battalion was reorganised and refitted 
      on board the "Transylvania" at Mudros.</P>
      <P align=justify>Our casualties were light amounting to only 30 to 40 all 
      told. Among these however was our Brigadier, Col. Linton, who died from 
      results of exposure on the water after his boat had overturned.</P>
      <P align=justify>In passing it is interesting to note that the commander 
      of the submarine published an account of this episode in a book of his war 
      experiences. This book came into the hands of Capt. A.S. Robertson of this 
      unit whilst a prisoner of war in Germany. The German version is, in main 
      accurate with the exception that the author claims to have sunk the 
      "Southland" and also that he came under heavy shellfire whereas in reality 
      only two shots were fired. The book in question is "U-Boot gegen U-Boot" 
      by Oberleutnant H. von Heimburg.</P>
      <P align=justify>We transhipped to the transport "Abassieh" on the evening 
      of 6<SUP>th</SUP> September and were landed at ANZAC Cove before midnight. 
      Next day we took over the line which was to be our home for 3 1/2 months. 
      Battalion H.Q. was in the terraces behind Scott’s Point. "A" and "B" 
      Company held the line from Wire Gully on the right where we joined the 
      22<SUP>nd</SUP> Battalion. "C" Company occupied Steel’s Post and "D" 
      Company, Courtney’s Post. On our left in Quinn’s Post was the 
      17<SUP>th</SUP> Battalion. The situation was at a deadlock when we arrived 
      and remained so until the evacuation. Our casualties from enemy action 
      were slight but constant work in the front line, short rations and dirt 
      caused much sickness and during our stay we dwindled from 1000 to 650 
      strong even with the addition of our 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Reinforcements who 
      joined us on the 11th October.</P>
      <P align=justify>On the morning of the 17<SUP>th</SUP> October the Turks 
      in front of Quinn’s and Courtney’s fraternised with out troops for about 
      half an hour during which time bully beef was exchanged for tobacco and 
      other trifles. Part of out routine was to supply a Beach Fatigue party of 
      100 Men. Although casualties with this party were more frequent than in 
      the trenches, there was great competition to be included in it, when it 
      changed monthly on account of the extra freedom of movement out of the 
      line.</P>
      <P align=justify>At the beginning of November we shortened out front by 
      handing over Steel’s and Courtney’s to the 18<SUP>th</SUP> Battalion and 
      taking over a short company front in the Tambour from the 22<SUP>nd</SUP>. 
      This enabled us to put 200 men on digging out the extensive tunnel system 
      designed for our winter quarters. During this month the weather which had 
      been perfect turned cold and on the night of the 26<SUP>th</SUP> we 
      experienced a blizzard. On the 29<SUP>th</SUP> we suffered a heavy 
      bombardment from the Turks, which was specially concentrated on Lone Pine 
      where the 23<SUP>rd</SUP> and 24<SUP>th</SUP> and 13<SUP>th</SUP> Light 
      Horse had heavy casualties.</P>
      <P align=justify>The 12<SUP>th</SUP> December saw us shifting out of the 
      front row for the first time. Two Companies went to the Pine ("A" and "B") 
      and the remainder of the Battalion went to Dead Man’s Gully to do the 
      necessary engineering work preparatory to the evacuation.</P>
      <P align=justify>The main portion of the Battalion left the Peninsula from 
      Watson’s Pier during the night 18/19 December. The remainder of 6 officers 
      and 214 OR left during the night 19/20<SUP>th</SUP>. The last two parties 
      of 6 men each were under Capt. Crowther and Capt. Duggan and left the 
      front trenches at 2.30 am and 2.48 am respectively on the 20<SUP>th</SUP> 
      December 1915. The Adjutant, Lt. A M Boothman and the RMO Capt. J p 
      Fogarty also remained and left with the last parties.</P>
      <P align=justify>We spent Christmas and New Year on Lemnos Island where we 
      camped at West Mudros. While here we received billies from Australia and a 
      very large mail. The villages near the camp were very interesting and we 
      thoroughly enjoyed the experience of being able to stretch our legs after 
      3½ months continuously cooped up in trenches 2 ½ feet wide and 8 to 10 
      feet deep.</P>
      <P align=justify>On the 4 January 1916 we embarked on the "Ascanins" for 
      Egypt and arrived in Alexandria on the 7<SUP>th</SUP> January after an 
      uneventful trip.</FONT></P>
