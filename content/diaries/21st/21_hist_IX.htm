    <td width="100%">&nbsp;<font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the night 21-22<sup>nd</sup>
    September we relieved the 18<sup>th</sup> Battalion (5<sup>th</sup> Brigade) in the left
    sector in front of Garter Point. We spent an inactive but wet time in the front row until
    relieved by the 32<sup>nd</sup> Battalion (5<sup>th</sup> Division) on the night 23-24<sup>th</sup>
    when we marched back to Dominion Camp (10 miles). Here we stood to under orders for an
    hours notice from the 26<sup>th</sup> till the 28<sup>th</sup> but did not finally move
    till early morning on the 30<sup>th</sup> when we billeted in what was left of the
    Infantry Barracks, Ypres, by 10.30 am.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our next move was to take part in the assault on Broodseinde Ridge in
    conjunction with the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Australian Divisions with several
    other divisions on right and left. The attack was part of a right flanking movement
    preparatory to the attack on Passchendaele, which was carried out by the Canadians. We
    spent the 3<sup>rd</sup> of October in Gordon Area just south of Ypres making final
    preparations and promulgating orders and the same night moved forward to out assembly
    position in a valley behind Garter Point and about a mile north of Hooge. At 3.10 am on
    the 4<sup>th</sup> we set out for the J.O.T (Jumping Off Tape) arriving an hour before
    Zero which was at 6 am. The Huns put down a murderous barrage thirty-five minutes be fore
    we started, we found out as the attack progressed that he intended to attack at the same
    zero hour as we did. That he used a thirty-five minute barrage indicates his different
    method of fighting and also the fact that when zero hour came it was the British who
    advanced and not the Hun. It shows the difference in the mettle of the opposing sides.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In spite of the units being disorganised by the pre-Zero Bombardment
    and all signalling gear having been destroyed our lines advanced from a position near
    Garter Point to the 2<sup>nd</sup> Objective on the forward slope of Broodseinde Ridge, a
    distance of nearly two miles, by far the greatest advance we had ever made.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The main characteristics of the battle were the pre-Zero German
    bombardment, which forced out troops right forward through our own barrage and the new
    experience of encountering &quot;pill boxes&quot;. This pill box method of defence is very
    effective as long as the whole system hangs out but as soon as one or two are captured or
    put out of action, the others can be approached from their &quot;blind spot&quot; which is
    no longer covered by machine gun fire from the flank. The troops quickly discovered this
    weakness and took full advantage of it. It was a fair battle, the enemy having the
    advantage of half an hours concentrated artillery fire on our lines but the fact that we
    reached our objectives according to plan and held or improved them speaks for itself. Our
    casualties would not have been heavy but for the towelling up we got on the tape which
    caused heavy losses while it lasted.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We remained in the line consolidating till the night 5-6<sup>th</sup>
    when the 18<sup>th</sup> Battalion relieved us and we moved to reserve at Kit and Kat in
    the old front line. We only stayed here till the afternoon of the 7<sup>th</sup> when we
    relieved part of the 20<sup>th</sup> Battalion in support at De Knoet Farm. The Brigade
    was very low in strength and orders were issued to attack as a composite battalion on the
    morning of the 9<sup>th</sup>. The 21<sup>st</sup> Battalion was to provide a composite
    company of six platoons with 9 officers. This show, known as the &quot;Daisy Wood
    Stunt&quot; or the &quot;9th October was another of out worst experiences. Rain had fallen
    and the ground was muddy. Our artillery or most of it had been bogged and was unable to
    put over anything but a meagre barrage. The only purpose the barrage served was to let the
    enemy know we were coming.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Zero was at 5.20 am and the J.O.T. on the line of our previous advance.
    All officers became casualties early in the engagement and the remainder of the action was
    carried on by the N.C.O.&#146;s with a mere handful of men. We reached the out skirts of
    Daisy Wood and Busy Wood as a very disorganised brigade but working from shell hole to
    shell hole, the position was held under exceptionally heavy machine gun and sniping fire.
    By 8.45 am, what was left of the brigade was roughly on its objective and the 7<sup>th</sup>
    Brigade coming up in support made the position more secure. The Brigade was relieved by
    the 49<sup>th</sup> Battalion (4th Division) the same night and was collected and
    reorganised as a composite battalion in the old support line. On the 10<sup>th</sup>
    October the composite battalion was withdrawn to the Canal Area at Ypres arriving about
    11pm.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On the morning of the 12<sup>th</sup>, the unit entrained at Ypres for
    Abeele and marched thence to billets in the Steenvoorde Area. We stayed there
    reorganising, training, playing games and cleaning up till the 27<sup>th</sup> October.
    The whole Division was depleted and reinforcements were sent from England as quickly as
    they came available. Rain fell throughout the month and the mud was ankle deep round the
    billets. On 2<sup>nd</sup> November we moved to camp in the Swan Area, Ypres where the
    conditions were even worse and on the 7<sup>th</sup> November relieved the 18<sup>th</sup>
    Battalion in supports at Garter Point, the Division having once more taken over the line.
    For four days we worked on carrying parties and cleaning up the area when the Division was
    relieved, the 6<sup>th</sup> Battalion, West Yorks. Regiment taking over out position and
    we moved back to the Swan Area once more.</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This was our final tour in the Ypres sector and in the morning of the
    12<sup>th</sup> November we marched to billets near Wippenhoek. Ypres in the autumn in
    1917 was an area of muddy shell holes over which only the paths were corduroy roads and
    duckboard tracks. These were all well registed by the enemy and movement was difficult in
    the forward areas. The battle on the 4<sup>th</sup> October was a Triumph as also was the
    following show on the 9<sup>th</sup>; both however cost us dearly. In the two shows we
    lost particularly heavily in officers, thirteen killed outright. The casualties for this
    period were: -</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Officers, 10 killed, 10 wounded, 3 missing, Total 23</p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other ranks, 62 killed, 330 wounded, 24 missing, </p>
