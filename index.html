This is a transcription of the diary of Verner Stuart Leslie Sanderson, describing his experiences in the first World War from the period July 17th 1915 to August 3rd 1917. The diary ends after his &quot;10 days dream&quot; leave to England from 21/7/17 to 3/8/17. <br><br>From there
his <a href="content\records\Service_records.pdf" target="blank">Service records </a> show that he remained in France until the end of March 1919. He had joined on the 28th July 1915 aged 28 and returned to Australia four years later on the 26th June 1919. He was discharged on the 22nd August 1919. He would have been 32 years old. In his diary we see reference to his brother George and sister Olive as well as the names of some of his friends Bert Siddell, Norman Wauchope, Norman Levick, Ella and Miss Pollock.
Given the time to do it and the necessary research into these people, one could compile a family history of the time and for the years thereafter. 
<br><br>
We are fortunate to have some glimpse into the personal experiences that Vern relates in his diary. I have made a small contribution to this by making the diary easier to read. There are two versions, one is a plain text transcription word for word as it was written, the other is a fully researched version including images, maps, video, military documents and links to other informative literature that gives us an insight into the goings on at the time and the conditions which he faced. 
<br><br>
I have annotated with sections taken from the web site of the Australian War Memorial 
<a href="http://www.awm.gov.au" target="blank">http://www.awm.gov.au</a>, in particular &quot;The Australian Imperial Official History of Australia in the War of 1914-1918&quot;, volumes III and IV authored by C.E.W. Bean. I have included these volumes
<a href="content\diaries\bean\bean_index.html" target="blank">here</a> for further study. 
They give a detailed and fascinating insight into the realities of the soldier&apos;s life during this time. All the volumes are available for download from the AWM site 
<a href="http://www.awm.gov.au/histories/volume.asp?conflict=1" target="blank">here.</a>.
<br><br>
There is much more information that can be gained from the AWM web site and other sources, some of which I have included here. A determined study of all this material including the 
<a href="content\diaries\5th_diaries_index.html" target="blank">Brigade Diaries</a> could better place his carefully dated movements. For now though this transcription gives us some idea.

<h3>The diary</h3>

<p style="background: palegoldenrod; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">

<a href="content\diary.html" target="blank"><b>A detailed and annotated version.</b></a><br><br>
You can explore the diary by clicking the link above.
Thoughout you will notice blue squares at the left margin. Move the cursor over these and you will see an extract fromt the 5th Brigade diary for this date. You might need to widen the browser window or scroll up or down to see the full contents. Click on the square to bring up the Diary for that month.
Many of the Brigade diaries are hand-written so it takes patience to read them but it is well worth the effort.
<br><br> Some of the pictures have an enlarged version and these are noted as necessary. Just click on the picture to see the larger version in a separate window. 
<br><br> Some maps and documents will be loaded in the same window so you need to click the "Back" button at the top to return to the diary.
<br><br> Where a video is available there is a note in the image caption. Click on the image to see the video. If you want to stop the video playback before it is finished, again just click the "Back" button.
<br><br>
At the time of writing in 2021, the diary is over 106 years old and so, with this in mind, I have made a photographic record that you can <a href="content\records\VSLS-diary-pages.zip" target="blank">download</a>. The hand writing is often difficult to read, so you can compare with a <a href="content\records\vsls_diary_plain.pdf" target="blank">transcript</a>.

<h3>Family history</h3>


<p style="background: palegoldenrod; border: 1px solid #0066FF; padding:8px">
As material is discovered, I will add it here.<br><br>
This is a family history compiled by his son, Robert, in January 1969.<br><br>

<a href="content\records\Sanderson-History_RLS.pdf" target="blank">Sanderson family 1969</a>
<br><br>
In his history he refers at the outset to Aunty Ella's writings and intended that should be read together.
<br>
Ella was Vern's sister and Aunty to the family. Their father was Francis Clement Villiers Sanderson and mother Emma Tortoise. Francis Clement Villiers was son of Francis Sanderson, the subject of Ella's writing, who originally came to Australia in 1852 as Ella details. This personal account adds depth and detail to other records.
<br><br>
<a href="content\records\ella-2.pdf" target="blank">Aunty Ella's writings</a>
<br><br>
Of great interest is a letter to my mother Shirley from Eileen Laing who lived in Spring Gardens, North Shields, Tyne and Wear. She researched the details of Ella's writings by personally visiting Libraries and Records Offices and has made some interesting corrections. She has also added great detail about heraldry and the family shield. It's most useful to read her letter side by side with Ella's writings. The "Dad" she is referring to is father of Ella and Vern, Francis Clement Villiers Sanderson.
<br><br>
<a href="content\records\Eileen-Laing.pdf" target="blank">Dad's family history - the Sandersons</a>
<br><br>
Here is a transcript, with modifications, of portions of a book compiled by Douglas Sanderson in 1969. In this you will find more detailed information relating back to the typewritten records of my Uncle Bob and his Aunty Ella.
